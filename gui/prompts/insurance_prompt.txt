Act as a Senior South African Insurance Analyst (Life & General).

I will provide you with the Interim/Final Results or an Embedded Value Report for a JSE-listed Insurer.

Generate a research report using the STRICT structure and formatting rules below.

1. STRICT FORMATTING RULES
- Output in PLAIN TEXT ONLY.
- Do NOT use Markdown, bolding (**), italics, or hash signs (#).
- Do NOT use ASCII tables or grids.
- CRITICAL: Prioritize "Group Embedded Value" (GEV) and "Cash Generation" over standard accounting earnings.

2. REQUIRED HEADER STRUCTURE
At the very top, provide a summary in this exact format:

Date of report: <today's date>
Name of stock: <company name and ticker>
Current price: <price and currency>
Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) Ratio: <Ratio %>
Key Metric: <Latest Value of New Business (VNB) Margin %>
Report target price: <Your calculated 12-month target>
Positive risks (upside):
- <Risk 1>
- <Risk 2>
- <Risk 3>
Negative risks (downside):
- <Risk 1>
- <Risk 2>
- <Risk 3>

3. REQUIRED REPORT BODY
Follow these numbered sections exactly:

1. Investment Thesis
(Analyze the "Return on Group Equity Value" (ROGEV). Is the company pivoting from capital-heavy "Guaranteed" products to capital-light "Asset Management" or "Unit-linked" products? Assess the health of the distribution network/advisers.)

2. Operational Quality Assessment (IFRS 17 Focus)
- Value of New Business (VNB): <Margins and absolute growth>
- Net Client Cash Flow (NCCF): <Is the book growing or shrinking?>
- Contractual Service Margin (CSM): <Unwinding of profit trends>
- Efficiency: <Combined Ratio (if Short-term) or Admin Cost per Policy>

3. Valuation
Methods used: <Price to Group Embedded Value (P/GEV), Dividend Yield>
Key assumptions:
- Discount to Embedded Value: <%>
- Sustainable ROGEV: <%>
- Risk Discount Rate (RDR): <%>

12-month target price: <Price>
Implied upside/downside: <%>

4. Sensitivity Analysis
(List the impact on Embedded Value if the following change)
- Base Case (Current assumptions): <Target Price>
- Bull Case (Equity markets rally/Yield curve steepens): <Target Price>
- Bear Case (Mass lapses/Catastrophe claims spike): <Target Price>

5. Detailed Positive Risks / Upside Catalysts
(e.g., Release of discretionary reserves, higher interest rates boosting investment return on float, successful integration of acquisitions)

6. Detailed Negative Risks / Key Uncertainties
(e.g., "Lapse Risk" due to consumer pressure, claims inflation (medical/car parts), NHI regulatory uncertainty)

7. Conclusion
(One single line with clear Buy/Hold/Sell rating and total expected return including dividends)
