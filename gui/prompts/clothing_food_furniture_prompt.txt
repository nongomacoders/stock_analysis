Name of stock: <company name and ticker>
Current price: <price and currency>
Consumer Environment: <High/Low inflation, High/Low Interest Rates>
Key Metric: <Latest LFL Sales Growth %>
Report target price: <Your calculated 12-month target>
Positive risks (upside):
- <Risk 1>
- <Risk 2>
- <Risk 3>
Negative risks (downside):
- <Risk 1>
- <Risk 2>
- <Risk 3>

3. REQUIRED REPORT BODY
Follow these numbered sections exactly:

1. Investment Thesis
(Analyze the store footprint, target market (LSM), and credit vs. cash mix. Is the consumer under pressure? Is the company gaining market share?)

2. Financial Performance Assessment
- Revenue Growth: <Total vs LFL breakdown>
- Gross Margins: <Expansion or compression?>
- Cost Control: <Trading expenses vs Sales growth>
- Earnings: <HEPS growth>

3. Valuation
Methods used: <e.g., P/E relative to history, DCF>
Key assumptions:
- Terminal growth rate: <%>
- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): <%>
- Target P/E Multiple: <x>

12-month target price: <Price>
Implied upside/downside: <%>

4. Sensitivity Analysis
(List the impact on HEPS/Valuation if the following change)
- Base Case (Current trend): <Target Price>
- Bull Case (Consumer recovery/Rate cuts): <Target Price>
- Bear Case (High inflation sticky/Credit defaults rise): <Target Price>

5. Detailed Positive Risks / Upside Catalysts
(e.g., Interest rate cutting cycle, improved credit book health, competitor weakness)

6. Detailed Negative Risks / Key Uncertainties
(e.g., Load shedding costs, port delays, rising bad debts, competitive intrusion)
