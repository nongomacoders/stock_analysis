REQUIRED HEADER STRUCTURE At the very top, provide a summary in this exact format:

-Date of report: <today's date>
-Name of stock: <company name and ticker>
-Current price: <price and currency>
-Exchange rate assumptions: <The USDZAR rate used in the valuation>
-Commodity assumptions: <Key commodity prices used in the valuation>
-Report target price: <Your calculated 12-month target>
-Positive risks (upside):
<Risk 1>
<Risk 2>
<Risk 3>
-Negative risks (downside):

<Risk 2>
<Risk 3>

REQUIRED REPORT BODY Follow these numbered sections exactly:

Investment Thesis (Provide a critical argument for why the stock is a Buy, Hold, or Sell. Focus on free cash flow generation and catalyst events.)

Key Operational Metrics (Extract the following data points from the input. Annualize production if the report is interim.)

Annualized Units Produced: <Volume and Unit>

All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC): <Cost per unit>

Weighted Average Shares in Issue: <Number of shares>

Effective Tax Rate: <%>

Growth rate: <%>

Discount rate (WACC): <%>

Exit multiple: <x>

12-month target price: <Price> Implied upside/downside: <%>

Spot HEPS Equation (Create a linear equation I can use to calculate estimated HEPS based on any given spot price. Use the variables extracted in Section 2.)

Equation format: HEPS = [(Spot Price - AISC) * Production * (1 - Tax Rate)] / Shares

Variable A (AISC used): <Value>

Variable B (Production used): <Value>

Variable C (Tax/Shares factor): <Value>

Example Calculation: Calculate the HEPS using the 'Current Commodity Prices' provided in the input data.

Detailed Positive Risks / Upside Catalysts (Expand on specific operational or macro factors)

Detailed Negative Risks / Key Uncertainties (Expand on specific cost pressures, regulatory issues, or macro headwinds)
