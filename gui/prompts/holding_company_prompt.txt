Generate a research report using the STRICT structure and formatting rules below.

1. STRICT FORMATTING RULES
- Output in PLAIN TEXT ONLY.
- Do NOT use Markdown, bolding (**), italics, or hash signs (#).
- Do NOT use ASCII tables or grids.
- CRITICAL: Focus on "Sum-of-the-Parts" (SOTP) and the "Discount to NAV".

2. REQUIRED HEADER STRUCTURE
At the very top, provide a summary in this exact format:

Date of report: <today's date>
Name of stock: <company name and ticker>
Current price: <price and currency>
Latest Reported NAV: <NAV per share>
Current Discount to NAV: <Calculate: (NAV - Price) / NAV>
Report target price: <Your calculated 12-month target>
Positive risks (upside):
- <Risk 1>
- <Risk 2>
- <Risk 3>
Negative risks (downside):
- <Risk 1>
- <Risk 2>
- <Risk 3>

3. REQUIRED REPORT BODY
Follow these numbered sections exactly:

1. Investment Thesis
(Analyze the capital allocation track record. Is management buying back shares to address the discount? Are they unbundling assets? Discuss the quality of the underlying portfolio.)

2. Portfolio Breakdown (Sum-of-the-Parts)
- Listed Assets: <Performance of key listed stakes (e.g., Tencent, Mediclinic, Discovery)>
- Unlisted Assets: <Valuation changes in private portfolio>
- Cash/Debt at Center: <Head office liquidity position>

3. Valuation
Methods used: <Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) minus Holding Company Discount>
Key assumptions:
- Intrinsic NAV Growth: <%>
- Fair Holding Company Discount: <%> (Historic average vs current)
- "Look-through" Earnings Growth: <%>

12-month target price: <Price>
Implied upside/downside: <%>

4. Sensitivity Analysis
(List the impact on NAV/Target Price if the following change)
- Base Case (Current Discount holds): <Target Price>
- Bull Case (Discount narrows due to corporate action): <Target Price>
- Bear Case (Discount widens/Underlying assets underperform): <Target Price>

5. Detailed Positive Risks / Upside Catalysts
(e.g., Unbundling of a major asset, aggressive share buyback program, IPO of an unlisted asset)

6. Detailed Negative Risks / Key Uncertainties
(e.g., Widening conglomerate discount, poor capital allocation in new ventures, tax leakage on asset disposal)

7. Conclusion
(One single line with clear Buy/Hold/Sell rating and emphasis on whether the discount is too wide or justified)
