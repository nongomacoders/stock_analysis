2025 H2 Distribution


Determination of currency amounts




Glencore confirms that:


  1.   On 28 May 2025, the shareholders resolved to pay an aggregate distribution of US$0.10 per


       share in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2024, payable in H1 and H2 in two


       equal tranches of US$0.05 per share from the capital contribution reserves of the Company.




  2.   This repayment is of US$0.05 per ordinary share and is to be made in US dollars, although


       shareholders on the Jersey register who have opted for a different currency by 1 September


       2025 will receive their distribution payments in either Pounds Sterling, Euros or Swiss Francs.


       Elections will remain in place until revoked by the shareholder.


  3.   The Pound Sterling, Euro and Swiss Franc amounts payable are determined by reference to


       the closing mid exchange rates applicable to the US dollar on 4 September 2025.




The following rates were published in the Financial Times guide to world currencies today:


 GBP/USD               EUR/USD              USD/CHF


 1.3426                1.1635               0.8067




Accordingly, for non-US dollar payments the amount payable per share on 19 September 2025 will


be approximately:


 Pounds Sterling       Euros                Swiss Francs


 0.037241              0.042974             0.040335




An announcement was made in South Africa on 19 August 2025 regarding the determination of


the South African Rand amount payable in respect of shares on the Johannesburg register.


The distributions for 2025 may be deemed "qualified dividends" for US Federal income tax


purposes (subject to certain holding period requirements). Distributions paid by the Company may


constitute "qualified dividends" because the Company is a "qualified foreign corporation" for US


Federal income tax purposes.






A copy of this announcement will be made available on the Company's website


(www.glencore.com).
