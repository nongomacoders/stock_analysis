Glencore Capital Markets Day 2025




? Significant progress on de-risking exceptional portfolio of copper assets with a pathway to


  produce c. 1 million tonnes by 2028 and target to produce c. 1.6 million by 2035


? Expected 4% overall annual compound growth rate in copper equivalent production from


  2026 level to 2029, with copper production itself expected to grow at 9.4% over this period


? Restart of Alumbrera copper mine


? Streamlined operating structure with focus on accountability and ownership to deliver safe


  and reliable operating performance.






Glencore will today host its Capital Markets Day at 1.00pm (UK). Webcast details and the


presentation slides are available here: 2025 Capital Markets Day




Glencore CEO Gary Nagle commented:




"Since our last Capital Markets Day in 2022, we have made significant progress on de-risking our


exceptional portfolio of copper projects. These projects are mostly brownfield and expected to be


highly capital efficient. We have a clear pathway for our base copper business to exceed 1 million


tonnes of annual production by the end of 2028, with a target to produce c. 1.6 million tonnes by


2035, which would make Glencore one of the largest copper producers in the world. We have


already taken key steps on this journey, including the submission of our Argentinian RIGI


applications in August and our decision to restart the Alumbrera copper/gold operation in


Argentina which we are announcing today.




"Our coal and energy businesses continue to play a strategic role in supporting the energy and


infrastructure needs of today and tomorrow, through our leading seaborne steelmaking and


energy coal assets as well as our rapidly growing LNG, power, gas and carbon marketing


businesses.




"At the same time, we have optimised and streamlined our industrial operating structures to


ensure accountability and ownership to deliver safe and reliable performance.




"Our unique marketing business continues to perform very well, and we have tailored our


capabilities to better reflect the product requirements of our global customer base. This


alignment allows us to leverage our multi-generational industrial assets, our strategic marketing


assets and the capabilities of our marketing infrastructure, to capture value across the supply


chain.




"Our constant focus on value creation for shareholders is reflected in the $25.3 billion of


announced shareholder returns over the last five years. While our copper business itself would be


expected to self-fund its full indicative growth pipeline, we will look at value-accretive


partnering/investor opportunities to reduce financial and operational risks in certain projects to


help deliver the right balance of growth and returns to shareholders in the years ahead.




"We remain committed to our strategy of energising today and advancing tomorrow. The rapidly


evolving global demands in connection with AI infrastructure and the ongoing energy transition


are expected to underpin a favourable outlook for our commodity portfolio.




"Copper has a critical role to play. When combined with the need for higher prices to stimulate


the significant required investment in copper mine supply, our strategic portfolio of copper


assets and projects are well positioned to help meet this supply challenge."




Details of the Alumbrera restart:




The operation is expected to restart in Q4 2026 with first production targeted in H1 2028. Once


fully operational, Alumbrera is expected to produce around c. 75,000 tonnes of copper, c. 317,000


ounces of gold and c. 1,000 tonnes of molybdenum during the four years of operations.




Beyond the stand-alone attractive economics, the restart is a natural enabler for Minera Agua


Rica ? Alumbrera (MARA). It reduces ramp-up risk for the concentrator and downstream logistics,


maintains and retrains the workforce ahead of MARA first ore and keeps critical infrastructure in


operation, ultimately expected to be shared with the MARA project, thereby generating


operational synergies.

Important notice




This document does not constitute or form part of any offer or invitation to sell or issue, or any solicitation of any offer to


purchase or subscribe for any securities. This document does not purport to contain all of the information you may wish


to consider.


Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking information




Certain descriptions in this document are oriented towards future events and therefore contains statements that are, or


may be deemed to be, "forward-looking statements" which are prospective in nature. Such statements may include,


without limitation, statements in respect of trends in commodity prices and currency exchange rates; demand for


commodities; reserves and resources and production forecasts; expectations, plans, strategies and objectives of


management; expectations regarding financial performance, results of operations and cash flows; climate scenarios;


sustainability (including, without limitation, environmental, social and governance) performance-related goals, ambitions,


targets, intentions and aspirations; approval of certain projects and consummation and impacts of certain transactions


(including, without limitation, acquisitions and disposals); closures or divestments of certain assets, operations or facilities


(including, without limitation, associated costs); capital costs and scheduling; operating costs and supply of materials and


skilled employees; financings; permitting, anticipated project timelines, productive lives of mines and facilities; provisions


and contingent liabilities; and tax, legal and regulatory developments.




These forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, or the negative thereof


including, without limitation, "outlook", "guidance", "trend", "plans", "expects", "continues", "assumes", "is subject to",


"budget", "scheduled", "estimates", "aims", "forecasts", "risks", "intends", "positioned", "predicts", "projects", "anticipates",


"believes", or variations of such words or comparable terminology and phrases or statements that certain actions, events


or results "may", "could", "should", "shall", "would", "might" or "will" be taken, occur or be achieved. The information in this


document provides an insight into how we currently intend to direct the management of our businesses and assets and


to deploy our capital to help us implement our strategy. The matters disclosed in this document are a 'point in time'


disclosure only. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather on current predictions,


expectations, beliefs, opinions, plans, objectives, goals, intentions and projections about future events, results of


operations, prospects, financial conditions and discussions of strategy, and reflect judgments, assumptions, estimates and


other information available as at the date of this document or the date of the corresponding planning or scenario analysis


process.




By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may


cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from any future events, results, performance,


achievements or other outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could


impact these uncertainties include, without limitation, those disclosed in the risk management section of our latest


Annual Report and/or Half-Year Report, which can each be found on our website. These risks and uncertainties may


materially affect the timing and feasibility of particular developments. Other factors which may impact risks and


uncertainties include, without limitation: the ability to produce and transport products profitably; demand for our


products and commodity prices; development, efficacy and adoption of new or competing technologies; changing or


divergent preferences and expectations of our stakeholders; events giving rise to adverse reputational impacts; changes


to the assumptions regarding the recoverable value of our tangible and intangible assets; inadequate estimates of


resources and reserves; changes in environmental scenarios and related regulations, including, without limitation,


transition risks and the evolution and development of the global transition to a low carbon economy; recovery rates and


other operational capabilities; timing, quantum and nature of certain acquisitions and divestments; delays, overruns or


other unexpected developments in connection with significant projects; the ability to successfully manage the planning


and execution of closure, reclamation and rehabilitation of industrial sites; health, safety, environmental or social


performance incidents; labour shortages or workforce disruptions; natural catastrophes or adverse geological conditions,


including, without limitation, the physical risks associated with climate change; effects of global pandemics and


outbreaks of infectious disease; the outcome of litigation or enforcement or regulatory proceedings; the effect of foreign


currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs; actions by governmental authorities, such as changes in


taxation or laws or regulations or changes in the decarbonisation policies and plans of other countries; breaches of


Glencore's policy framework, applicable laws or regulations; the availability of sufficient credit and management of


liquidity and counterparty risks; changes in economic and financial market conditions generally or in various countries or


regions; political or geopolitical uncertainty; and wars, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism, cyber attacks or sabotage.


Readers, including, without limitation, investors and prospective investors, should review and consider these risks and


uncertainties (as well as the other risks identified in this document) when considering the information contained in this


document. Readers should also note that the high degree of uncertainty around the nature, timing and magnitude of


climate-related risks, and the uncertainty as to how the energy transition will evolve, makes it particularly difficult to


determine all potential risks and opportunities and disclose these and any potential impacts with precision. Neither


Glencore nor any of its affiliates, associates, employees, directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation,


warranty, assurance or guarantee as to the accuracy, completeness or correctness, likelihood of achievement or


reasonableness of any forward-looking information contained in this document or that the events, results, performance,


achievements or other outcomes expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this document will actually


occur. Glencore cautions readers against reliance on any forward-looking statements contained in this document,


particularly in light of the long-term time horizon which this document discusses in certain instances and the inherent


uncertainty in possible policy, market and technological developments in the future.




No statement in this document is intended as any kind of forecast (including, without limitation, a profit forecast or a


profit estimate), guarantee or prediction of future events or performance and past performance cannot be relied on as a


guide to future performance.




Except as required by applicable rules or laws or regulations, Glencore is not under any obligation, and Glencore and its


affiliates expressly disclaim any intention, obligation or undertaking, to update or revise any forward-looking statements,


whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. This document shall not, under any circumstances,


create any implication that there has been no change in the business or affairs of Glencore since the date of this


document or that the information contained herein is correct as at any time subsequent to its date.




Sources


Certain statistical and other information included in this document is sourced from publicly available third-party sources.


This information has not been independently verified and presents the view of those third parties, and may not


necessarily correspond to the views held by Glencore and Glencore expressly disclaims any responsibility for, or liability in


respect of, and makes no representation or guarantee in relation to, such information (including, without limitation, as to


its accuracy, completeness or whether it is current). Glencore cautions readers against reliance on any of the industry,


market or other third-party data or information contained in this document.




Information preparation


In preparing this document, Glencore has made certain estimates and assumptions that may affect the information


presented. Certain information is derived from management accounts, is unaudited and based on information Glencore


has available to it at the time. Figures throughout this document are subject to rounding adjustments. The information


presented is subject to change at any time without notice and we do not intend to update this information except as


required.




This document contains alternative performance measures which reflect how Glencore's management assesses the


performance of the Group, including results that exclude certain items included in our reported results. These alternative


performance measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measonnes of molybdenum during the four years of operations.




Beyond the stand-alone attractive economics, the restart is a natural enabler for Minera Agua


Rica ? Alumbrera (MARA). It reduces ramp-up risk for the concentrator and downstream logistics,


maintains and retrains the workforce ahead of MARA first ore and keeps critical infrastructure in
