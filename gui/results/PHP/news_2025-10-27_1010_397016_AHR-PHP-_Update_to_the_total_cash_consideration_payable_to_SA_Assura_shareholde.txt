Overseas Shareholders


The information contained in this Announcement constitutes factual advice as contemplated in section 1(3)(a)


of the South African Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 37 of 2002, as amended ("FAIS Act")


and should not be construed as express or implied advice (as that term is used in the FAIS Act and/or the


South African Financial Markets Act, 19 of 2012, as amended) that any particular transaction in respect of the


Combination, is appropriate to the particular investment objectives, financial situations or needs of a


shareholder, and nothing in this Announcement should be construed as constituting the canvassing for, or


marketing or advertising of, financial services in South Africa.


Nothing in this Announcement should be viewed, or construed, as "advice", as that term is used in the South


African Financial Markets Act, 19 of 2012, as amended.


Neither this Announcement, nor the New PHP Shares, the Original Combined Circular and Prospectus, the


Supplementary Prospectuses, the Original Offer Document, the Revised Offer Document, the Second Form of


Acceptance or any other offering document has been approved or disapproved by the SEC, any state


securities commission in the United States or any other U.S. regulatory authority, nor have such authorities


passed upon or determined the adequacy or accuracy of the information contained in any of those documents


or passed upon or endorsed the merits of the Combination. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal


offence in the United States.


It may be difficult for Assura Shareholders in the United States to enforce their rights and any claims they may


have arising under the U.S. federal securities laws in connection with the Combination, since PHP and Assura


are located in countries other than the United States, and all or some of their officers and directors may be


residents of countries other than the United States. U.S. holders of shares in PHP or Assura may not be able


to sue PHP, Assura or their respective officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of U.S. securities


laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel PHP, Assura and their respective affiliates to subject themselves to


the jurisdiction or judgment of a U.S. court.


The New PHP Shares have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or under the


securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States and may not be offered, taken up, sold,


resold, delivered, pledged, renounced, distributed or otherwise transferred, directly or indirectly, in or into the


United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, any U.S. Person except in transactions exempt from, or


not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and in compliance with any applicable


securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States.
