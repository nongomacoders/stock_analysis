      Notes:


      1. 'Adjusted earnings, which is a tax adjusted measure of revenue profit, is the basis for the calculation


         of adjusted earnings per share. PHP believes adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share


         provide further insight into the results of the Company's operational performance to stakeholders as


         they focus on the net rental income performance of the business and exclude capital and other items


         which can vary significantly from year-to-year; and


      2. The main difference between HEPS and EPS are due to non-cashflow gains and losses arising on


         the valuation of the Company's property portfolio. EPS were further impacted by non-cashflow losses


         arising from convertible bond and interest rate derivates.


2.   OUTLOOK


     PHP continues to believe the compelling strategic and financial rationale for the recommended combination


     with Assura plc ("Assura"). We are also pleased to have secured strong support for the transaction from


     PHP shareholders at our general meeting with over 99% of voting shareholders approving the proposed


     combination which is a strong endorsement of the Company's ability to deliver an earnings accretive


     transaction.


     At an important time for our sector, a combined group creates a strong platform that offers scale, income


     and valuation growth with both resilience and an important social purpose. UK PLC ownership of primary


     care facilities also provides appropriate stewardship of these social infrastructure assets.


     PHP welcomes the Governments 'fit for the future' 10-year Health Plan for the NHS in England with its


     emphasis on shifting services to modern primary care facilities in a community setting. Our track record in


     primary care and relationships with NHS stakeholders place PHP at the centre of the solution to deliver on


     the Government's plan. This backdrop, together with the improving rental growth outlook, and the potential


     for valuations to be at an inflexion point in the current economic cycle represents a very encouraging


     outlook for the combined group over the long term.


     PHP has delivered another period of strong operational and financial performance with a focus on driving


     rental growth from our existing assets and are encouraged by the firmer tone of rental growth experienced


     over the last couple of years. We believe the dynamics of inflation in recent years, including significantly


     increased build costs combined with demand for new primary care facilities and the need to modernise


     the estate will continue to drive future rental settlements.


     These factors, along with the encouraging Government commitments to a neighbourhood health service


     and the resulting increased investment in primary and community care, enable us to look forward to the


     rest of 2025 and beyond with confidence.
