Operational review


The group delivered a resilient performance in the first half of the 2026 financial year, achieving 5% income growth


to R3.1 billion (2024: R3.0 billion), driven primarily by strong domestic trading where South African operations rose


8% to R3.0 billion. This performance was partially offset by a 29% decline in offshore revenue to R147 million, following


the temporary closure of Paradise Sun for refurbishment and weaker trading in Maputo and Tanzania.


South African hotels achieved occupancy of 60.6% (2024: 59.4%) and a 6% increase in average room rates (ARR) to R1 369,


lifting rooms revenue to R2.0 billion (2024: R1.8 billion). Demand was supported by conferencing, events, and group travel


in Gauteng and the Western Cape, while transient corporate and government travel remained subdued due to delayed national


budget approvals and Easter timing. Recovery in these segments is ongoing, aided by upcoming G20 and B20 conferences. The


group experienced higher than expected cost pressures that weighed on margins, driven primarily by increases in information


technology, utilities, and channel costs.


Despite these headwinds, South African Ebitdar increased 6% to R827 million (2024: R783 million) underscoring the strength


of the domestic portfolio. In contrast, offshore operations posted a R9 million loss (2024: R39 million profit), resulting


in group Ebitdar of R818 million (2024: R822 million) and a margin of 26% (2024: 28%). On 30 September 2025, the group


successfully refinanced its debt package into two-year revolving credit facilities maturing on 30 September 2027, with an


option to extend for a further 12 months to 30 September 2028. Net interest-bearing debt increased to R481 million at


30 September (2024: R995 million), up R215 million from the year-end balance of R266 million.


Given the seasonal weighting of profits to the second half, no interim dividend has been declared for the six months


ended 30 September 2025 which is consistent with the prior-year interim decision.


Prospects


Paradise Sun's relaunch has been well received, trading at strong occupancy and ARR levels, with momentum expected to


continue into H2. In South Africa, major events including the G20 conference taking place in November 2025, repeat anchor


events like the Parliamentary opening and Mining Indaba as well as various sporting events are expected to support the


group's peak summer period.


Medium-term recovery of occupancies to long-term averages presents upside potential, aided by policies that encourage


economic growth. The softening of inflation along with South Africa's removal from the Financial Action Task Force's


grey list are tailwinds that signal improved investor confidence and stronger economic growth. However, interest rates


remain high and continues to constrain consumer and investor confidence.


October 2025 delivered group-wide occupancy of 73.3% and revenue growth of 18%. Ebitdar was up a pleasing 27% on the


prior period - this was the highest occupancy achieved, surpassing World Cup levels in June 2010.
