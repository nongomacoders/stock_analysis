Overview


Founded in 1969, Italtile Limited is a Proudly South African manufacturer, franchisor and


retailer of tiles, bathroomware and other complementary home-finishing products.


The Group's retail brands are CTM, Italtile Retail and TopT, represented through a total


network of 210 stores, including seven online webstores. The brand offering targets homeowners


across LSM 4 to 10. The retail operation is strategically supported by a vertically integrated


supply chain comprising key manufacturing and import operations and an extensive property


portfolio.


Group performance


System-wide turnover for the year decreased 2% driven by a small increase in retail revenue,


but a decline in revenue in supply chain businesses and Ceramic Industries. Retail sales


improved slightly (1%), while market share improved with sales transactions increasing 1,3%


and basket size decreased 0,7% as price sensitive customers bought down. Retail margins


continued to be under pressure and declined 0,7%, with a 0,2% increase in average selling price.


Retail profits for the period increased 1%.


Our East African operations delivered a good performance due to the stronger regional economy,


strategic trading enhancements and an improved product range. We continue to bed down relatively


new stores and assess opportunities to open new stores in Kenya. In the Southern African region,


Botswana's margins have been impacted by aggressive pricing by independents supplied by other


regional manufacturers.


Our Webstore continued its strong performance and increased traffic and sales, underpinned by


improved digital content offering an innovative online experience and personalised sales expertise.


Trading conditions in Ceramic's market continued to deteriorate mainly due to excess manufacturing


capacity in the Southern African region. Reduced margins weighed heavily on the performance of the


tile division, with a 5% reduction in volume sold and, despite moving to larger formats, a decline


of 2,1% in average selling prices per square metre for tiles. Export sales decreased significantly


due to tariffs in our two biggest export markets, Zambia and Zimbabwe.


The Ceramic team responded to reduced volumes by decreasing costs and improving efficiencies,


with assistance from our supply partners. Despite efforts to control costs, like-on-like margin


value decreased driven primarily by lower capacity utilisation in our volume-sensitive factories.


Ezee Tile achieved a small increase in revenue but significant improvement in margins, following


further efficiencies in the Vulcania factory and regional factory upgrades. Performance of the


Silica Quartz sand mining and processing businesses was disappointing. An Ezee Tile management


priority will be to improve efficiencies and unlock value from this acquisition.


In the integrated supply chain, revenue from Cedar Point, International Tap Distributors (ITD)


and Distribution Centre (DC) decreased 2,9% mainly due to substitution of imported tiles


from SADC suppliers. DC unlocked efficiencies through in-sourcing warehouse operations in Durban,


better stockturn and reduced freight costs, and successfully completed the integration of


Cedar Point Durban into the DC warehouse resulting in cost savings. Cedar Point grew sales


through improved product availability and rationalised ranges, enabling faster introduction of


new, fashionable products. ITD grew sales volumes from retail stores and maintained margin


despite a decrease in average selling price and ongoing exchange rate volatility.


Cost leadership is a core discipline, driven hard by management, with Group operating costs


reducing 2,8%. The key focus was on containing logistic costs and improving productivity and


efficiencies. Net finance income increased due to higher average cash balances during the year.


Group trading profit was similar to prior year at R 2 061 million. With a 1% decrease in weighted


number of shares, EPS increased 3% on the prior year.


Total inventory holdings decreased 3% to R1 228 million due to improved system-wide stockturns.


Projects to further improve logistics to reduce lead times and improve stockturn are expected to


deliver further inventory reduction despite plans to open additional stores. The Group continues


to benefit from its integrated supply chain with 86% of total procurement sourced from local


manufacturers and suppliers. Optimal product mix and range was supported by our business


optimisation programme.


Cash generation enables investment requirements and dividend payments. Debt levels remain low


providing a solid financial foundation. Managed capital investment for the next year will support


value creation for core businesses. We pursue ongoing prudent capital allocation and cost control


to strengthen resilience.


Prospects


We expect continued headwinds to subdue growth, margins and profitability in the year ahead.


We believe that a rigid focus on the controllable aspects of our business will position us to


capitalise on opportunities when the trading environment improves. Our priorities will be to


strengthen leadership through personal development, invest in our brands and product development,


optimise operational efficiencies, improve productivity, control costs, reinforce the Group as a


selling organisation, reduce inventory and grow market share. As part of our continual review


of our asset base, we will consider disposals of non-core assets and focus on our core


productive assets.


Organic growth will continue to be driven by capitalising on our leading brand positions in


South Africa and our growing brand strength in East Africa. Our strategic initiatives include


investment in our new product development programmes, excellent customer service and our brand


portfolio. Group synergy will be leveraged within our portfolio of complementary businesses.


The emphasis on strong human capital management will continue in the new year as we prioritise


strong leadership, effective training programmes and excellence in attracting, recruiting,


developing and retaining talent in alignment with our high-performance culture.


As South Africa persists in allowing uncontrolled dumping of product in the country which,


coupled with import tariffs imposed by neighbouring countries, worsens the trading environment


and places margins under pressure, management will continue to engage the authorities to gain


the government's support for a level domestic playing field.


We have sound assets, competent, engaged and motivated teams, robust iconic brands, industry-leading


technology and products, and the competitive advantage of a vertically integrated supply chain.


Productivity and efficiency are critical in an environment where GDP growth is limited aggregated


by growing competition. We strive to remain a low-cost manufacturer and world-class retailer.


We are confident that if we execute retail excellence disciplines better at every customer


touchpoint and continue to reduce inefficiencies, we will deliver increased sales, profit growth,


and gain market share. We will improve customer experience, operating efficiencies and logistics,


and develop and grow our teams' core competencies in sales and operating excellence.
