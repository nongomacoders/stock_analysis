CONDENSED UNAUDITED              INTERIM     RESULTS     FOR    THE    SIX   MONTHS      ENDED


31 AUGUST 2025


1.   CONDENSED UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED


     31 AUGUST 2025


     SALIENT FEATURES


     ?     As at 31 August 2025, Zeder's net asset value per share ("NAVPS") was R1.68,


           representing a decrease of 21.9% (or 47 cents per share) when compared to the NAVPS


           of R2.15 as at 31 August 2024. The decrease was mainly as a result of the special


           dividends of 31.0 cents per share paid to Zeder shareholders and the downward


           adjustments in the valuation of the unlisted investments compared to the previous


           corresponding period.


     ?     Other:


           o    Both headline and attributable loss per share increased by 143.9% from 4.1 cents


                to 10.0 cents, mainly as a result of the aforementioned downward adjustments in


                the valuation of the unlisted investments, countered by dividend income received.


           o    Loss before taxation from continued operations per Zeder's consolidated income


                statement increased by 107.0% from a loss of R71m to R147m, mainly as a result


                of the aforementioned.


           o    No ordinary dividends were declared during the six months ended 31 August 2025


                (31 August 2024: nil; 28 February 2025: nil). No special dividends were declared


                during the six months ended 31 August 2025 (31 August 2024: 30.0 cents per


                share; 28 February 2025: 61.0 cents per share).


     STRATEGIC FOCUS


     Zeder's objective remains to maximise long-term wealth for its shareholders.


     The Zeder board is engaged in advance discussions with third parties on Zaad and continues


     to assess further wealth maximising strategies in a responsible way, which may also include


     the orderly disposal of individual assets comprising the Zaad portfolio.


     In this regard, Zeder announced on 26 March 2025 that the Company, through its subsidiaries


     and indirect subsidiaries of Zaad, had entered into separate sale of shares agreements with


     ETG Inputs to dispose of its operations in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Zambia, including the


     intellectual property rights associated with said operations held by Bakker Brothers in the


     Netherlands, as one indivisible transaction, for an aggregate consideration of R135m.


     In addition, Zaad also entered into an agreement to dispose of its non-core Angolan chemical


     operations for an aggregate consideration of R45m.


     The aforementioned disposals are subject to outstanding approvals from the competition


     commission (all applications have been lodged) with effective dates anticipated during October


     or November 2025.


     BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUTLOOK


     The macro environment remained constrained during the period under review, primarily due


     to ongoing global market risks and the continued conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern


     Europe. Zeder anticipates that uncertainty and volatility will persist in these operating markets.


     In terms of our remaining portfolio investment, exciting new growth markets have been


     established on the seed and chemical side of our South African operation, while EA Seeds has


     promising growth prospects in the Eastern African markets, especially in the hybrid seed maize


     market.


     Despite these challenges, Zeder remains well-positioned supported by a stable balance sheet


     and cash resources.


2.   DIVIDEND


     Zeder's dividend policy remains to distribute dividends subject to the Group maintaining


     sufficient cash reserves to support its operations and where necessary, the growth plans of its


     investee' companies. In light of ongoing uncertainty and volatility in global markets, the board


     has resolved not to declare a dividend at this time, but will consider future distributions when


     conditions are deemed appropriate.

     This short-form announcement ("Results Announcement") is the responsibility of the


     directors of the Company. The unaudited financial results for the six months ended
