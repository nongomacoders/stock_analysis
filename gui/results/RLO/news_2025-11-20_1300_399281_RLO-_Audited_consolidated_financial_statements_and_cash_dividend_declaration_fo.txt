Reunert delivers strong second half performance and creates momentum for growth




OPERATING ENVIRONMENT




The 2025 financial year (2025) was characterised by a challenging South African market, partially offset by positive growth in the Group's non-South African


markets. The defence sector remained strong and both the African and international markets in the Electrical Engineering Segment retained their solid growth


trajectory.




OVERVIEW




Within this operating environment, the Group's businesses have performed well, specifically in the second half of 2025 (H2 FY: 2025) where an increase of 6%


in continuing operations headline earnings per share (HEPS) was delivered over the prior comparative period. This strong second half performance enabled


the Group to recover much of the earnings shortfall from the first half of 2025 and resulted in a full year decrease in HEPS from continuing operations of


only 5% to 649 cents per share (cps) (2024: 685 cps).




In South Africa, the Group's businesses demonstrated good resilience, retained market share, controlled costs well and generated strong cash flows, all of


which reflect the strength of the Reunert investment case and the quality of the Group's assets. Good strategic progress was made by the Group in increasing


its presence in international markets and optimising the Group's portfolio.




Importantly, the Group's cash flow generation remained positive as free cash flow remained in line with historic norms at R1 170 million


(2024: R1 222 million), which enabled an increase in the final dividend declaration in line with growth in the H2 FY: 2025 financial results.




The pleasing strategic progress, the Group's positive financial performance, specifically the H2 FY: 2025 performance, and strong cash flows have generated


meaningful momentum in the Group. These established the base for the Group's growth trajectory into 2026.




GROUP RESULTS - CONTINUING OPERATIONS




The Group's revenue decreased by 2% to R13 881 million (2024: R14 228 million), while the Group's operating profit decreased by 8% to R1 515 million


(2024: R1 640 million). The Group has once again generated a robust cash flow from its operations of R1 623 million (2024: R1 866 million). The Group invested


R225 million (2024: R223 million) in fixed capital expenditure, of which R130 million was in respect of expansion projects (2024: R122 million). The Group has


total available funding facilities of R2 875 million (2024: R3 100 million) and remains in compliance with all its covenants. The net cash position of the


Group has improved to R743 million (2024: R536 million) and consequently the Group has been able to improve its total dividend (paid and declared) for the


financial year by 5% to 383 cps (2024: 366 cps).




SEGMENTAL REVIEW OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS




Electrical Engineering




The segment had a challenging year due to three primary matters, namely:




i.   Negative growth in South Africa's gross domestic fixed investment;


ii.  The United States of America (USA) import tariffs applied to South African imports; and


iii. Product mix and foreign exchange losses in Zambia.




These three factors were the primary reasons for segment revenue decreasing by 3% to R7 458 million (2024: R7 682 million), while segment operating profit


fell by 31% to R461 million (2024: R665 million).




South African power cable volumes fell by 9% as the expected fixed infrastructure investment failed to materialise. The business managed its cost base well


and lean manufacturing programs delivered improved efficiencies, but were insufficient to offset the financial impact of the decreased volumes.




In Zambia, total volumes remained nominally stable as decreased offtake from ZESCO, the Zambian power utility, was offset by improved volumes of power cable


and copper rod into the neighbouring regions. The product mix of these volumes resulted in lower margins being attained. The rapid appreciation of the


Zambian Kwacha against the US Dollar contributed to the decrease in profitability for the year. Importantly, the business environment in the country remains


positive for continued healthy financial performances.




The circuit breaker volumes in South Africa decreased slightly year-on-year but were more than offset by a strong export performance. The USA remains a


significant market and the actions taken have ensured that the circuit breaker business's market share has been retained and volumes into the USA are


expected to continue to increase.




ICT




The South African market for the Group's ICT businesses remained challenging as low GDP and weak business confidence extended sales cycles and reduced


market activity. In this environment, segment revenue remained flat at R3 903 million (2024: R3 897 million) and segment operating profit reduced by 9% to


R644 million (2024: R706 million).




The decrease in segment operating profit all occurred in the Solutions and Systems Integration Cluster as key customers reduced spending. Importantly, the


business restructured its cost base, aligning it to the expected future demand. The restructuring process, and all the associated costs, were concluded in


the current year.




The rest of the segment's clusters performed solidly and, collectively, delivered a growth in operating profit over the prior year. The Business


Communications Cluster performed well with a pleasing growth in  operating profit.




In the Total Workspace Provider Cluster, Nashua delivered a stable revenue and operating profit result, despite complementary revenues coming under pressure


as renewable energy sales fell due to reduced loadshedding in the country.




The Rental-based Finance Cluster performed well. The cluster's revenue was negatively impacted by a lower average rental book than the prior year, and the


lower interest rates. This was, however, more than overcome by further efficiencies delivered through the implementation of improved control systems and


processes.




Applied Electronics




The Applied Electronics Segment's segment revenue decreased by 7% to R2 756 million (2024:  R2 974 million). The reduction in revenue was caused by the


impact of a stronger Rand on the cluster's large foreign denominated export revenues and a reduced demand in the local maintenance and support services


market. The quality of the revenues was, however, much improved as segment operating profit increased by 21% to R500 million (2024: R414 million), driven by


efficient production, improved margins and some foreign exchange gains made on long-term export contracts.




Defence




The Defence Cluster had an excellent year. Record financial performances were delivered by the radar and fuze businesses as they executed their strong order


books and delivered improved operating profit and margins. There were also good performances from Dynamic Control, Etion Create and the communications


business, which all contributed to the strong operating profit and margin improvement for the cluster.




The long-term market demand for the cluster's products and services remains positive. All key geographies serviced by the cluster retain their strong demand


patterns and the cluster's growth trajectory is supported by a positive pipeline of orders-on-hand and contracts near conclusion.




The Defence Cluster progressed well on its initiatives of entrenching its market access in the key geographies of the Middle East and Europe.




Strategic intellectual property co-development projects in radar are nearing conclusion. This opens the opportunity for long-term participation in


subsequent production programmes and entrenches the radar business as a key partner in these rollouts. Good opportunities have also been developed across


the cluster on additional strategic intellectual property co-development projects.




Renewable Energy




The growth continued in the Group's solar energy business as EBITDA exceeded the prior year. The business delivered good project margins and increased the


key strategic target of the number of owned assets under management during the year. By year-end the owned, in-construction and near-financial close


Build-Own-Operate (BOO) plants increased by 22% to 95MW (2024: 78MW).




PROSPECTS




The momentum created through the Group's positive second half performance and strategy execution, positions Reunert well for growth in the 2026 financial


year. It is anticipated that the South African economy will steadily improve as the impact of the energy, rail and port infrastructure investments


continues, private participation in infrastructure projects increases and the benefits of the structural improvements flow into the economy. Reunert's track


record reflects that steady economic improvement results in positive operating leverage and improved financial performance. Pressure is, however, expected


to continue on the Electrical Engineering product volumes in the South African businesses until infrastructure investment increases, which is not anticipated


to change materially in the first half of the new financial year. The South African businesses in the Electrical Engineering Segment are at least expected


to perform in line with 2025's performance.




Reunert will continue executing on its strategy in 2026:




i.   where solid growth is expected from offshore markets in the Defence Cluster and circuit breaker business;


ii.  a re-focussed and restructured ICT Segment is set to deliver sustainable growth; and


iii. the Group's renewable energy investments are expected to grow in both asset ownership and an enhanced trading footprint.




CASH DIVIDEND




Notice is hereby given that a gross final cash dividend No. 199 of 293,0 cents per ordinary share (September 2024: 276,0 cents per ordinary share) has been


declared by the directors for the year ended 30 September 2025.




The dividend has been declared from retained earnings. A dividend withholding tax of 20% will be applicable to all shareholders who are not exempt from, oONS
