Group profile


Famous Brands is Africa's leading food services franchisor, with restaurants in South Africa, Southern African


Development Community (SADC), the Rest of Africa and the Middle East (AME) and the United Kingdom (UK). Our


vertically integrated business model comprises four pillars: Brands, Manufacturing, Logistics and Retail.


Our portfolio of 15 iconic restaurant brands appeals to consumers across income and demographic bands, meal


preferences and value propositions. The portfolio is segmented into Leading Brands (mainstream) and Signature


Brands (niche). Leading Brands are further categorised as Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) and Casual Dining


Restaurants (CDR). Our QSR brands prioritise takeaway and delivery with smaller sit-down areas, while CDR brands


offer a full-service, sit-down experience. Our Signature Brands offer a range of bespoke offerings. Our Supply


Chain refers to our Manufacturing, Logistics and Retail operations, which offer our franchise partners efficient


supply, price certainty, product innovation and margin management. Our Retail operations sell products


to major national retailers.


Our restaurant network


We have  3 008 restaurants across 20 countries.

Operating context1


South Africa's economic growth increased to 0.8% in Q2 2025, a rebound from 0.1% growth in Q1. Other positive


developments include the cessation of load shedding, improvements to the national logistics network and relative


political stability. In addition, traffic has increased, supported by return-to-office mandates,


boosting restaurant sales.


Consumer spending remains constrained due to high unemployment, household indebtedness and elevated


inflation in recent years. Competition for consumer spending is intense, especially in the QSR category,


as brands invest in campaigns to promote core categories at competitive prices. Consumers seek value in an


increasingly competitive environment, including competition from supermarket retailers' rapid delivery offerings.

Financial performance


Our financial performance demonstrated strong momentum, with positive results across key financial metrics.


Revenue increased by 5.6% to R4.2 billion (2024: R4.0 billion), and operating profit increased by 5.8% to


R393 million (2024: R371 million). The Group's operating profit margin was 9.3% (2024: 9.2%). Headline earnings per


share (HEPS) increased by 8.0% to 236 cents (2024: 218 cents), while basic earnings per share (BEPS) increased


by 6.8% to 236 cents (2024: 221 cents).


Sustained consumer preference for our South African Leading Brands portfolio, particularly for the QSR brands,


led to robust revenue growth, which in turn lifted the performance of our Manufacturing and Logistics divisions.


In addition, we experienced strong growth in our brand footprint.


We continued to pursue operational efficiencies and cost containment initiatives. This included the opening of our


cold storage facility in June 2025, which was completed on time and within budget. The new facility will increase


capacity, reduce transport costs and result in savings from more energy-efficient refrigeration technologies.

Capital allocation


Gearing


The Group's total borrowings position at 31 August 2025 was R1.1 billion (2024: R1.2 billion). During the review


period, we repaid R62 million of borrowings and raised a similar amount for the development of the cold storage


facility. The Group's finance costs on borrowings decreased by 23% compared to the same period in 2024, due to a


reduction in debt and interest rate cuts (50 basis points).


Capital expenditure


We invested R140 million (2024: R91 million) in capital expenditure, allocating capital in line with the Group's strategy.


Dividend


The Board declared an interim dividend of 162 cents per share (2024: 150 cents per share). The dividend will be paid


from profits for the review period, amounting to a total of R162 million. In terms of dividends tax legislation, the


following additional information is disclosed:

Operational review


Brands


Revenue for SA increased by 6.3% to R599 million (2024: R563 million).


Operating profit declined by 0.4% to R231 million (2024: R232 million).


System-wide sales across our SA brand portfolio improved by 5.5% and like-for-like sales increased by 2.4%.


Leading Brands - SA


Leading Brands' system-wide sales increased by 6.0%, and like-for-like sales increased by 2.6%. Restaurant sales were


boosted by an uptick in local tourism and increased traffic resulting from return-to-office mandates. Our QSR brands


performed strongly due to their competitive value offerings, successful promotions and prudent cost management.


Leading Brands experienced strong growth in its brand footprint, with 27.8% of new restaurants allocated to


existing franchise partners. We expanded our footprint of smaller restaurant formats and drive-thrus to meet


consumer demand for convenience. The pleasing revamp activity demonstrates franchise partners' trust in our brands


and willingness to reinvest in their businesses.


Signature Brands - SA


The Signature Brands portfolio delivered softer results than anticipated, driven by lower consumer demand for


premium dining out. Like-for-like sales and system-wide sales declined by 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. Operating


loss margin was (7.0%) (2024: (6.7%)).


SADC


The region experienced steady growth, with revenue increasing by 2.7% to R224 million (2024: R218 million).


Operating profit declined by 11.8% to R24 million (2024: R28 million). Operating profit margin was 10.9%


(2024: 12.7%). Botswana's system-wide restaurant sales decreased by 2.3%, and like-for-like sales declined by 5.5%


compared to the prior period. Zambia's system-wide sales were 4.8% higher than the prior period, while like-for-like


sales declined by 3.2%.


AME (outside of SADC)


Revenue declined by 5.4% to R33 million (2024: R35 million). Several markets are experiencing tough trading


conditions and high inflation. Our brand presence remains sub-scale in the region. Operating loss was


(R19 million) (2024: (R22 million)), while the operating loss margin was (57.2%) (2024: (63.4%)).


UK


The UK restaurant industry has been battling with cost pressures, cautious consumers and economic uncertainty, resulting


in constrained sales. Revenue declined by 5.7% to R65 million (2024: R69 million). Operating profit decreased to


R1 million (2024: R3 million). Operating profit margin was 2.2% (2024: 4.6%).


Looking forward


We remain cautiously optimistic regarding the remainder of the 2026 financial year, with modest but positive growth


predicted for South Africa, underpinned by recovering domestic demand, lower inflation and interest rates and a


more stable energy supply.


Competitive intensity, especially from value-driven offerings, is expected to increase, requiring strategic


flexibility to maintain market share and profitability. This involves agility with menu options, promotions and


loyalty programmes. We will leverage our new consumer engagement platform to provide compelling, personalised


offers to our customer base. The restaurant pipeline is healthy with demand for Leading Brands and Signature


Brands. The principle of two separate portfolios is working well, with resources being dedicated appropriately to the


relevant growth opportunities.


Expansion in the SADC region will follow a targeted focus on specific markets. We will remain cautious in the AME


markets. We are committed to reducing the drag on our profitability from the AME and Signature Brands portfolios.


The Manufacturing division is deploying manufacturing technology, processes and resource planning to increase


capacity, improve production yields and reduce waste. We will also grow revenue by increasing the range of products


offered to franchise partners and the retail market.


Our Logistics division will improve its efficiencies through fleet mix optimisation, route planning, bringing retail


frozen distribution in-house and taking on the distribution of the Coca-Cola beverage basket in eight provinces.


Our warehouse management system will support better planning and decision-making.


There are strong indications that Retail performance will improve in the remainder of the 2026 financial year. We


are executing a retail marketing strategy to secure new product listings and promote our ranges to consumers.


We have confidence in our ability to innovate and grow, supported by dedicated franchise partners. Improved


profitability will be supported by our ongoing efforts to contain costs and improve efficiency. We are committed to


improving shareholder returns, reducing our legacy debt and supporting the sustainability of our franchise partners.

Supply chain


MANUFACTURING


Manufacturing revenue increased by 10.4% to R1.8 billion (2024: R1.6 billion), mainly driven by price inflation and a positive


shift in product mix. The division experienced strong volume growth for core lines, including cheese, sauces and meat products.


Operating profit increased by 23.6% to R185 million (2024: R150 million) due to improved production yields, reduced input costs


for key ingredients and cost savings realised from the division's efficiency drive. Above-inflation expenses include municipal


and electricity price hikes, as well as increased repairs and maintenance. Beef prices in the second quarter were challenging,


resulting in R30 million margin erosion as pricing was absorbed during the market volatility. Operating profit margin was 10.4%


(2024: 9.3%).


LOGISTICS


Logistics revenue increased by 7.4% to R2.7 billion (2024: R2.5 billion) as the division's case volumes grew by 1.9% and


price inflation increased by 5.1%. Operating profit declined by 14.8% to R29 million (2024: R34 million), due to inflationary


cost pressures. Operating profit margin decreased to 1.1% (2024: 1.4%).


RETAIL


Retail revenue remained flat at R171 million (2024: R171 million), primarily due to lower sales volumes of frozen potato chips


resulting from sustained competition. Volumes for coffee products at restaurants and retail also remain depressed due to higher


global coffee prices. The division had an operating loss of (R12 million) (2024: (R2.6 million)). We launched three new


products (2024: one).


A live webcast of the Group's interim results presentation will be held on Wednesday, 22 October 2025 at 10h30 (SAST)
