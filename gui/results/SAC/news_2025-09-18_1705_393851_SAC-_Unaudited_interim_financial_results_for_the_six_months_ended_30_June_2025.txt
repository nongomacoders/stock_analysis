Tax implications


In accordance with the Company's REIT status, shareholders are advised that the distribution meets the requirements of a qualifying


distribution for the purposes of section 25BB of the Income Tax Act, No 58 of 1962 (Income Tax Act). The distributions on the Company's


shares will be deemed to be dividends, for South African tax purposes, in terms of section 25BB of the Income Tax Act. The distributions


received by or accrued to South African tax residents must be included in the gross income of such shareholders and are not exempt from


income tax (in terms of the exclusion to the general dividend exemption, contained in paragraph (aa) of section 10(1)(k)(i) of the Income


Tax Act) because they are dividends distributed by a REIT, with the effect that the distribution is taxable in the hands of the shareholder.


These distributions are, however, exempt from dividend withholding tax in the hands of South African tax resident shareholders, provided that


the South African resident shareholders have provided the following forms to their Central Securities Depository Participants (CSDP) or broker,


as the case may be, in respect of uncertificated shares, or the transfer secretaries, in respect of certificated shares:


(a) a declaration that the distribution is exempt from dividends tax; and


(b) a written undertaking to inform the CSDP, broker or the transfer secretaries, as the case may be, should the circumstances affecting the


    exemption change or the beneficial owner ceases to be the beneficial owner, both in the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African


    Revenue Service.


The Company's shareholders are advised to contact the CSDP, broker or transfer secretaries, as the case may be, to arrange for the above-mentioned documents


to be submitted prior to payment of the distribution, if such documents have not already been submitted.


Notice to non-resident shareholders


Distributions received by non-resident shareholders will not be taxable as income and instead will be treated as ordinary dividends which are exempt from income


tax in terms of the general dividend exemption in section 10(1)(k)(i) of the Income Tax Act. Distributions received by a non-resident from a REIT are subject to


dividend withholding tax at 20%, unless the rate is reduced in terms of any applicable agreement for the avoidance of double taxation (DTA) between South Africa


and the country of residence of the shareholder.


Assuming dividend withholding tax will be withheld at a rate of 20%, the net dividend amount due to non-resident shareholders is 10.41126 cents per SA Corporate


share. A reduced dividend withholding rate, in terms of the applicable DTA, may only be relied on if the non-resident shareholder has provided the following forms


to the CSDP or broker, as the case may be, in respect of uncertificated shares, or the transfer secretaries, in respect of certificated shares:


(a) a declaration that the dividend is subject to a reduced rate as a result of the application of a DTA; and


(b) a written undertaking to inform the CSDP, broker or the transfer secretaries, as the case may be, should the circumstances affecting the reduced rate change


    or the beneficial owner ceases to be the beneficial owner, both in the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service.


Non-resident shareholders are advised to contact the CSDP, broker or the transfer secretaries, as the case may be, to arrange for the above-mentioned documents to


be submitted prior to payment of the distribution if such documents have not already been submitted, if applicable.
