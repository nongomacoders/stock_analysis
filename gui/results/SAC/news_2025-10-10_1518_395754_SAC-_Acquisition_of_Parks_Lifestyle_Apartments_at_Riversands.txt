Acquisition of Parks Lifestyle Apartments at Riversands


SA CORPORATE REAL ESTATE LIMITED


(Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa)


(Registration number 2015/015578/06)


JSE share code: SAC ISIN: ZAE000203238


(Approved as a REIT by the JSE)


("SA Corporate" or "the Company")


ACQUISITION OF PARKS LIFESTYLE APARTMENTS AT RIVERSANDS


1.    Introduction


      Shareholders are advised that SA Corporate, through its subsidiary Afhco Holdings Proprietary


      Limited ("Afhco" or the "Purchaser"), has concluded a sale of shares and claims agreement (the


      "Agreement") with CH Development Investments Proprietary Limited and Century Property


      Developments Proprietary Limited (collectively referred to as the "Sellers" and each a "Seller")


      pursuant to which, subject to the fulfilment or waiver of the conditions precedent as set out in


      paragraph 3.2 ("CPs"), Afhco will acquire all the shares and claims in and against Riversands


      Residential Apartments Proprietary Limited (the "Acquiree") at a transaction value equal to


      R1,671 million (the "Purchase Consideration") (excluding acquisition costs), subject to the


      terms set out below (the "Acquisition").


      The Sellers' group will complete the development of a new block of 40 units ("New Block"),


      provided that if the New Block is not completed by implementation of the Acquisition ("Phase 2")


      a portion of the Purchase Consideration of up to R31 million (based on progress to date)


      ("Deferred Purchase Consideration") will be deferred and paid when Phase 2 reaches


      applicable development milestones. The New Block will be underpinned by a 12-month net


      operating income guarantee described in further detail in paragraph 3.2.


      The Acquiree owns 100% of Parks Lifestyle Apartments at Riversands (the "Parks" or the


      "Property"). The beneficial owner of the Sellers is the MAC Trust (the "Trust"). The beneficiaries


      of the Trust are all individuals, none of whom are related parties to SA Corporate.


2.    Information on the Property and rationale for the Acquisition


      The Property prior to completion of Phase 2 ("Phase 1") comprises 1,960 residential units with a


      total gross lettable area ("GLA") of 118,528m². The Property is located in the rapidly growing


      Riversands development area near Steyn City, Fourways, which offers a secure, convenient, and


      high value living environment for residents. The unit mix includes bachelor, one, two, and three-


      bedroom apartments within three storey blocks.


      The Acquisition presents an opportunity for SA Corporate to further its strategic focus on high


      quality, precinct-based developments that align with its long-term goals of sustainability,


      defensive income, and enhanced stakeholder value. As confirmation, SA Corporate does not


      currently own or manage property with the same scale or mixed-use development potential as


      the Parks, making this a compelling strategic expansion. Further rationale for the Acquisition


      includes:


      2.1.   Strengthening the residential portfolio quality and scale


             -     The Parks provides a high quality, scalable residential asset that supports SA


                   Corporate's growth in the middle-income rental market; and


             -     The Acquisition will increase SA Corporate's exposure to suburban estates which is


                   expected to increase to 67.2% (currently: 58.7%) of SA Corporate's residential


                   portfolio.


      2.2.   Attractive and sustainable rental fundamentals


             -     The Parks delivers strong occupancy and stable cash flows due to affordability,


                   lifestyle offering and supply constrained location.


      2.3.   Extensive lifestyle amenities enhancing tenant appeal


             -     Green spaces, recreational facilities, and enhanced security increase tenant


                   retention and attractiveness;


             -     Facilities include a clubhouse, swimming pool, gym, restaurant, cinema, games


                   room and executive lounges; and


             -     Family-friendly amenities enhancing tenant appeal including walking paths, kids'


                   play parks, sports fields, on-site nursery school, adjacent private primary school,


                   water park with super-tubes and beach area.


     2.4.   Strategic location in a high growth node


             -     Situated in Riversands, the Parks benefits from strong infrastructure, proximity to


                   employment hubs and potential long-term appreciation; and


             -     The Parks is a flagship quality suburban estate in keeping with characteristics of the


                   global multifamily housing sub-sector.


     2.5.   Alignment with responsible investment and community focus


             -     SA Corporate's commitment to ethical investment, sustainability and community


                   upliftment is reflected in the Parks' design and management philosophy. The


                   Property enhances quality of life through well-considered urban living, aligning with


                   SA Corporate's long-term ESG objectives.


             -     This commitment is further demonstrated through the achievement of EDGE


                   certifications across 1,960 residential units, comprising 1,432 units with EDGE


                   Advanced certification and 528 units with EDGE certification. These certifications


                   recognise energy savings of up to 46%, water savings of up to 23%, reductions in


                   embodied energy of up to 30%, and meaningful cuts in operational carbon


                   emissions, reinforcing SA Corporate's responsible investment strategy.


     2.6.   Value underpin


             -     Value is underpinned by the ability to sell units into the retail market at sub 8% yields


                   as evidenced by sales at comparable estates; and


             -     The Acquisition establishes a partnership with a highly reputable developer.


     2.7.   Enhances ability to dispose of other units within the Afhco portfolio at attractive


            yields


             -     The Acquisition of 2,000 units provides SA Corporate with the ability to dispose of


                   other less strategic units (within its residential portfolio) at sub 8.5% yields.


     2.8.   Residential Property Management Platform economies of scale


             -     The addition of 2,000 apartments will enhance the efficiencies derived from


                   economies of scale within SA Corporate's established residential property


                   management platform.


3.   Terms of the Acquisition


     3.1.   Effective date


            The Acquisition is expected to close and take effect on the first business day of the month


            following the month in which the last of the CPs are fulfilled, or to the extent legally


            permissible, waived ("Closing Date").


     3.2.   Application and settlement of Purchase Consideration


            The upfront portion of the Purchase Consideration of R1,640 million for Phase 1 will be


            applied as follows:


            -     first, to settle any external debt of the Acquiree ("Acquiree Debt") to be confirmed


                  by a settlement statement obtained from the Acquiree's debt funders;


                  -        second, as consideration for the acquisition by the Purchaser of the loan owing by


                           the Acquiree to the Seller (the "Shareholder Loan"), being an amount of R125


                           million under the relevant loan agreement; and


                  -        the remaining balance of the Purchase Consideration as consideration for shares in


                           the Acquiree.


                The Dities, and enhanced security increase tenant


                   retention and attractiveness;


             -     Facilities include a clubhouse, swimming pool, gym, restaurant, cinema, games


                   room and executive lounges; and


             -     Family-friendly amenities enhancing tenant appeal including walking paths, kids'


                   play parks, sports fields, on-site nursery school, adjacent private primary school,


                   water park with super-tubes and beach area.


     2.4.   Strategic location in a high growth node


             -     Situated in Riversands, the Parks benefits from strong infrastructure, proximity to


                   employment hubs and potential long-term appreciation; and


             -     The Parks is a flagship quality suburban estate in keeping with characteristics of the


                   global multifamily housing sub-sector.


     2.5.   Alignment with responsible investment and community focus


             -     SA Corporate's commitment to ethical investment, sustainability and community

                   certifications across 1,960 residential units, comprising 1,432 units with EDGE


                   Advanced certification and 528 units with EDGE certification. These certifications


                   recognise energy savings of up to 46%, water savings of up to 23%, reductions in


                   embodied energy of up to 30%, and meaningful cuts in operational carbon


                   emissions, reinforcing SA Corporate's responsible investment strategy.


     2.6.   Value underpin


             -     Value is underpinned by the ability to sell units into the retail market at sub 8% yields


                   as evidenced by sales at comparable estates; and


             -     The Acquisition establishes a partnership with a highly reputable developer.


     2.7.   Enhances ability to dispose of other units within the Afhco portfolio at attractive


            yields


             -     The Acquisition of 2,000 units provides SA Corporate with the ability to dispose of

             -     The addition of 2,000 apartments will enhance the efficiencies derived from


                   economies of scale within SA Corporate's established residential property

3.   Terms of the Acquisition


     3.1.   Effective date


            The Acquisition is expected to close and take effect on the first business day of the month


            following the month in which the last of the CPs are fulfilled, or to the extent legally


            permissible, waived ("Closing Date").


     3.2.   Application and settlement of Purchase Consideration


            The upfront portion of the Purchase Consideration of R1,640 million for Phase 1 will be


            applied as follows:


            -     first, to settle any external debt of the Acquiree ("Acquiree Debt") to be confirmed


                  by a settlement statement obtained from the Acquiree's debt funders;


                  -        second, as consideration for the acquisition by the Purchaser of the loan owing by


                           the Acquiree to the Seller (the "Shareholder Loan"), being an amount of R125


                           million under the relevant loan agreement; and


                  -        the remaining balance of the Purchase Consideration as consideration for shares in


                           the Acquiree.


                The Deferred Purchase Consideration will be payable to the Seller upon certain milestones


                being reached, the last of which being the issuance of the temporary occupancy certificate


                for the New Block of 40 units once construction of the New Block is completed.


                In addition, the Seller will provide a monthly net operating income ("Monthly NOI")


                guarantee ("NOI Guarantee") of R316,667. To the extent that the Monthly NOI amounts


                to less than the NOI Guarantee, the Sellers will pay the deficit to the Purchaser every


                month for the first-12 months post-closing in respect of Phase 2.


                The Purchase Consideration will be funded through a combination of SA Corporate's and


                Afhco's existing and new debt facilities, disposal proceeds and / or equity to be raised. The


                3-year Afhco debt to be raised will be competitively priced at a margin of 125 bps above


                3-month JIBAR, secured to fund socially responsible investment in affordable


                accommodation residential property.


        3.3.    Conditions precedent


                The Acquisition is subject to fulfilment or, where appropriate, waiver of the following


                outstanding CPs, that by no later than 28 February 2026 (the "Longstop Date"):


                -        all required consents or approvals are obtained from the relevant debt funding


                         counterparties of the Acquiree, and to the extent that SA Corporate refinances the


                         Acquiree Debt, confirmation that such refinancing will not trigger any defaults,


                         prepayments or penalties;


                -        any releases of security provided by (a) the Acquiree for the Sellers' group debt and


                         obligations; and (b) the Sellers' group from the Acquiree's debt and obligations, are


                         procured;


                -        the necessary approvals (or exemptions) from the Competition Authorities and any


                         other applicable regulatory authorities, either unconditionally or subject to conditions


                         acceptable to the Purchaser, the Sellers and the Acquiree, within the relevant


                         statutory timelines, are received; and


                -        Within 10 business days following fulfilment or waiver of all the above CPs, SA


                         Corporate must deliver the funding confirmation notice to the Seller.


                Any of the dates in respect of the CPs set out above may be extended by mutual


                agreement between the Purchaser, the Sellers and the Acquiree in writing.


                The Agreement contains warranties and undertakings which are normal for a transaction

5.      Financial information


        The forecast financial information relating to the Acquiree ("Forecast") for the first 12 months of


        ownership by SA Corporate ("Forecast Period") is set out below.


        The Forecast has been prepared on the assumption that the Closing Date will occur on 1 January


        2026 and on the basis that the Forecast includes forecast results for the duration of the Forecast


        Period.


        The Forecast, including the assumptions on which it is based and the financial information from


        which it has been prepared, is the responsibility of the directors of the Company. The Forecast,


        and any other financial information in this announcement, has not been reviewed or reported on


        by the Company's external auditor.


        The Forecast presented in the table below has been prepared in accordance with the Company's


        accounting policies, which are in compliance with IFRS Accounting Standards:


                                                              Forecast for the 12 months ending 31


                                                                                     December 2026


 Rental income                                                                        R191,700,792


 Recovery income                                                                       R55,330,581

 Finance costs                                                                        -R79,082,749


 Profit before tax                                                                     R80,496,309


 Tax                                                                                            R0


 Distributable profit                                                                  R80,496,309


      The Forecast incorporates the following material assumptions in respect of revenue and


      expenses:


      (1)    The Forecast is based on information derived from the rent roll, budgets and additional


             information provided by the Sellers.


      (2)    The Forecast has been prepared for the Acquisition only and includes the Seller's R3.8


             million NOI Guarantee for the first year post the Closing Date in respect of Phase 2. It is


             assumed that the Property will not be sold during the Forecast Period.


      (3)    The Forecast assumes the Acquisition will be debt funded on a 57% loan to value ratio (at


             the pricing as stated in paragraph 3.2). It should be noted that the SA Corporate group is


             settling more expensive debt from disposals to ensure SA Corporate's target gearing is


             achieved.


      (4)    Whilst the Forecast allows for a property management fee of 4% plus VAT, the Forecast


             does not make provision for any economies of scale that SA Corporate will achieve through


             its residential property management platform.


      (5)    Net operating income does not include the effects of straight lining rental income.


      (6)    No fair value adjustment is recognised.


      (7)    Rental income comprises individual leases signed on a month to month basis and all


             contracted rental agreements are assumed to be valid and enforceable.


      (8)    Vacancies and rental increases have been forecast based on historic metrics.


      (9)    Operating expenditure has been estimated with reference to contracted terms and


             prevailing sector forecasts.


      (10)   There will be no unforeseen economic factors that will affect rental to be received from


             tenants and current operating expenditure.


      The Acquisition is at a forecast 9.55% first year net property income yield and is expected to


      result in accretion of more than 1.5% to SA Corporate's distributable income per share within 12


      months of implementing the Acquisition.


5.    Categorisation


      The Acquisition is classified as a category 2 acquisition in terms of the Listings Requirements of


      the JSE Limited and accordingly does not require SA Corporate shareholder approval.


      The Company confirms, for purposes of paragraph 9.16 of the Listings Requirements, that


      nothing in the constitutional documents of the Acquiree will, in any way, frustrate or relieve SA


      Corporate from complying with its obligations in terms of the Listings Requirements.
