             advised it will be vacating the Yaldwyn Properties at the expiry of its current lease in


             September 2027.


      2.2.   The Disposal Consideration will be applied to recycle capital into assets with greater


             growth potential.

      3.1.   The ultimate beneficial shareholder of the Purchaser is the JAM Trust.


      3.2.   The Disposal Consideration is payable by the Purchaser on the Transfer Date.


      3.3    The Disposal is subject to the fulfilment or waiver of the condition precedent that, to the


             extent necessary, by no later than 120 days from the signature date of the Agreement, the


             Disposal has been unconditionally approved by the South African competition authorities


             or conditionally approved on terms and conditions acceptable to the parties.
