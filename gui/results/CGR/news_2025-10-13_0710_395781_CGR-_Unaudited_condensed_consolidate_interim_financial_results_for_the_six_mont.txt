         Operational performance


         This period's results reflect short-term revenue and profitability pressures as a result of the shift in


         capital allocation to the Bankenveld District City project where infrastructure installation has


         commenced, revenue from these installations will be recognised upon finalisation of public sector


         agreements. With gross profit margins maintained, the asset base expanded, and liquidity


         preserved, the Group is well positioned for long-term #sustainablegrowth through the


         implementation of its strategic pillars.


         We have dedicated significant time to rethinking our operations, drawing on decades of experience


         in residential property development and more recent expertise in memorial parks management.


         This has enabled us to refine our strategic pillars, focusing capital on future opportunities that


         optimise the portfolio and reduce debt through the sale and completion of non-contributing assets


         and projects.


         As reported in the February 2025 year-end results, the Group held large stock on hand. We are


         pleased to have reduced the number of units on hand by more than half in the six-month period


         through innovative targeted marketing campaigns and the sale of units to the property investor


         market.


         On-site infrastructure activities have commenced at Platinum City Memorial Park where final


         regulatory approvals were obtained in the reporting period. Burials are expected to commence in


         the last quarter of the 2026 financial year, providing in excess of 28 000 burial opportunities to the


         Group. Once this Memorial Park becomes fully operational, and in line with the Group's growth


         strategy, further investments will be directed toward replacing end-of-life parks over the short to


         medium term to support growth in the segment.


      Memorial Parks continued to support Group liquidity through predictable cash inflows, with stable


      cash collections for the period of R51.64 million (August 2024: R52.15 million) contributing towards


      Group overheads. Lay-by cash collections increased by 22.27% to R14.9 million (August 2024:


      R12.24 million). This strategic shift in sales strategies adopted two years ago, to the lay by market


      supports predictability in the cash flows as evidenced by cash collections growing to approximately


      28% of total cash collections.


      Contributions from the broader residential development pipeline remained well balanced, with


      construction activities on Western Cape projects increasing during the period.


      The installation of the final stages of infrastructure in the Belhar project was undertaken, while


      successfully completing and selling out a further section of the Scottsdene development. This


      positions the Western Cape projects to make a large contribution towards performance in the


      second half of the financial year. In Gauteng, on the existing pipeline, the final bulk and link


      installations in Fleurhof and Jabulani are nearing completion. These installations, along with bulk


      and link investments which occurred over the preceding financial years, resulted in 2 589 serviced


      opportunities currently available for development across the residential developments pipeline.


2.    PROSPECTS


      Calgro M3 continues to experience demand for both residential housing units and memorial park


      burial sites, solidifying its strategic focus on high-demand niches in the South African economy.


      The reductions in interest rates have shown a positive response, albeit at a slower pace than


      initially anticipated. Despite the interest rate being held at the current level by the Monetary Policy


      Committee during September, market sentiment shows an uptick and both increases in home loan


      volumes and approvals across the market.


      The implementation of the strategic pillars outlined is necessary as the Bankenveld District City


      development begins and the Group positions to execute on fewer projects with equitable


      contribution levels. At the same time, the Memorial Parks business has matured, is extremely cash


      generative and is poised for further growth. This revitalised strategy which supports future growth


      has invigorated the entire business whilst also ensuring that the debt structure of the business is


      aligned with its size and capital requirements.
