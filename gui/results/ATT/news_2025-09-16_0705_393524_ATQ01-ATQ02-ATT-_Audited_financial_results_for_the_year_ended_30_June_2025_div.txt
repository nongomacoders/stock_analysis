Declaration of a cash dividend


The board declared a final gross cash dividend of 43.00000 cents per share out of the company's distributable income, which equates to a payout ratio of 80.3%. This


brings the full-year dividend to 87.00000 cents per share (June 2024: 69.0 cents per share).


The dividend is payable to Attacq shareholders in accordance with the timetable set out below:


                                                           2025


Last day to trade cum dividend               Tuesday, 7 October

Record date                                  Friday, 10 October


Payment date                                 Monday, 13 October


Notes:


1. Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 8 October 2025 and Friday, 10 October 2025, both days inclusive.


2. Payment of the dividend will be made to shareholders on Monday, 13 October 2025. In respect of dematerialised shareholders, the dividend will be transferred


   to the Central Securities Depository Participant (CSDP) account or broker account on Monday, 13 October 2025. Certificated shareholders' dividends will be


   deposited on or about Monday, 13 October 2025.


3. Where the transfer secretaries do not have the banking details of any certificated shareholders, the cash dividend will be held in trust by the transfer secretaries


   pending receipt of the relevant certificated shareholder's banking details, whereafter the cash dividend will be paid via electronic transfer into the personal bank


   accounts of certificated shareholders.


Due to Attacq's status as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), shareholders are advised that the dividend meets the requirements of a "qualifying distribution" for


the purposes of section 25BB of the Income Tax Act, No 58 of 1962 (Income Tax Act). The dividend on the shares will be deemed to be a taxable dividend for South


African tax purposes in terms of section 25BB of the Income Tax Act.


Tax implications for South African resident shareholders


The dividend received by or accrued to South African tax residents must be included in the gross income of such shareholders and will not be exempt from income


tax (in terms of the exclusion to the general dividend exemption contained in paragraph (aa) of section 10(1)(k)(I) of the Income Tax Act) because it is a dividend


distributed by a REIT. This dividend is, however, exempt from dividend withholding tax (dividend tax) in the hands of South African tax resident shareholders,


provided that South African tax resident shareholders provide the following forms to their CSDP or broker, as the case may be, in respect of uncertificated shares, or


the company, in respect of certificated shares:


a) a declaration that the dividend is exempt from dividend tax


b) a written undertaking to inform the CSDP, broker or the company, as the case may be, should the circumstances affecting the exemption change or the beneficial


   owner cease to be the beneficial owner both in the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service.


Shareholders are advised to contact their CSDP, broker or the company, as the case may be, to arrange for the abovementioned documents to be submitted before


payment of the dividend, if such documents have not already been submitted.


Tax implications for non-resident shareholders


Dividends received by non-resident shareholders will not be taxable as income and instead will be treated as ordinary dividends which is exempt from income tax


in terms of the general dividend exemption in section 10(1)(k)(i) of the Income Tax Act. Any distribution received by a non-resident from a REIT will be subject


to dividend withholding tax at 20.0%, unless the rate is reduced in terms of any applicable agreement for the avoidance of double taxation (DTA) between South


Africa and the country of residence of the shareholder. Assuming dividend withholding tax will be withheld at a rate of 20.0%, the net dividend amount due to non-


resident shareholders is 34.40000 cents per share.


A reduced dividend withholding rate in terms of the applicable DTA may only be relied on if the non-resident shareholder has provided the following forms to their


CSDP or broker, as the case may be, in respect of uncertificated shares, or the company, in respect of certificated shares:


a) a declaration that the dividend is subject to a reduced rate as a result of the application of a DTA


b) a written undertaking to inform their CSDP, broker or the company, as the case may be, should the circumstances affecting the reduced rate change or the


   beneficial owner cease to be the beneficial owner both in the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service.


Non-resident shareholders are advised to contact their CSDP, broker or the company, as the case may be, to arrange for the above-mentioned documents to be


submitted before payment of the dividend if such documents have not already been submitted, if applicable.


The number of shares in issue on 30 June 2025 and the date of this announcement is 746 198 337 ordinary shares of no par value, which includes


46 427 553 treasury shares. Attacq's tax reference number is 9241/038/64/6.


Prospects and guidance


The group expects to grow its DIPS in FY26 by between 7.0% and 10.0%, with a dividend payout ratio of 80.0%.


The anticipated growth in DIPS is expected to be driven by several key factors: NOI growth supported by rising market rentals, disciplined cost management, and


the successful leasing of vacant spaces and completed developments. Furthermore, the installation of PV systems and the implementation of the power purchase


agreement are expected to reduce electricity costs and enhance operational efficiencies.


This guidance is based on the following key assumptions:


- No material impact on distributable income due to new developments, acquisitions or disposals


- Forecasted rental income being achieved based on contractual terms and anticipated market-related renewals


- No major changes in vacancy rates


- No significant increase in load-shedding and the resultant increase in costs


- No unforeseen circumstances such as major corporate tenant failures or deterioration of the current macro-economic environment


- This guidance has not been audited or reviewed by Attacq's auditors.
