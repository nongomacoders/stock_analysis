SEGMENTAL HIGHLIGHTS


Agriculture


- Revenue up 11% to R5 663 million


- Operating profit up 9% to R458 million


- Operating margin down 2% to 8.1%


The Agriculture segment delivered a resilient financial performance, effectively managing several challenges including a prolonged supplier shutdown, adverse climatic conditions in select international markets, currency volatility and increasing uncertainty in the global trade environment. Agile operations, increased demand and favourable pricing dynamics supported the result.


The integrated manufacturing and supply chain capabilities, which provide a key competitive advantage in the SADC region, successfully navigated the impacts of extended supplier shutdowns (including ammonia, steam, rail and water). This was mitigated through strategic inventory management and its agile operations, to ensure security of supply to customers.


In South Africa, the extended supplier shutdowns in the first quarter of FY26 affected ESG metrics, manufacturing volumes and overhead recovery rates. The business delivered strong sales volumes, supported by Omnia's proprietary Nutriology approach, favourable agronomic conditions and pricing dynamics. Rest of Africa benefited from improved agronomic conditions, a strengthening macroeconomic environment and operating model changes. Agriculture International saw increased biostimulant exports to key markets, overall performance was however impacted by droughts in Australia and Brazil. The strategy to grow the distribution footprint in the USA and Brazil is gaining traction, driven by demand for sustainable farming solutions and high quality input.


Continued good agronomic conditions and early rains underpin our optimism for good demand in the second half for the South African business. The Rest of Africa division is well positioned for an improved season, supported by effective supply chain execution. Agriculture International is expected to deliver growth through its expanding wholesale distribution footprint and its biostimulant offering. Export volumes are set to increase in key Asian markets, while efforts to grow the business in Australia continue. In Brazil, the business is driving organic growth by expanding into new high value crop regions and pursuing strategic B2B opportunities.


Overall, the Agriculture segment continues to demonstrate resilience and agility across diverse markets. The outlook remains positive, supported by favourable agronomic conditions in SADC and focused strategic execution.


Mining


- Revenue up 3% to R4 845 million


- Operating profit up 7% to R570 million


- Operating margin up 4% to 11.8%


The Mining segment delivered a strong performance despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, characterised by trade and currency volatility and its impact on commodity prices. Revenue, profitability and margin growth were driven by increased volumes in the SADC region, although this was partially offset by lower volumes in the coal and diamond sectors. Delivery was supported by Omnia's integrated manufacturing and supply chain capabilities.


In West Africa, BME maintained its strong operational performance, however, political instability in the region persists. In Indonesia, strategic efforts to diversify into the metals sector remain a priority, with business and technology integration progressing to plan. Commissioning of both non-electric and electronic detonator plants in Canada marked a key milestone in enabling distribution opportunities into the North American market. Infrastructure development is supporting the execution of the organic growth strategy in Australia. BME's Metallurgy division delivered solid results, driven by growth in the uranium sector in Namibia and increased sales of ammonia derivatives.


The Mining segment is well positioned for growth across its core explosives and chemicals markets, despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Strategic efforts are focused on organic growth, contract expansion, and operational optimisation across regions including SADC, West Africa, Australia, Canada and Indonesia. Key initiatives include commissioning new plants and expanding technology partnerships. Infrastructure for the hydrogen peroxide emulsion plant in Canada will be completed in the second half of FY26. This is an important milestone for BME and will set the foundation for the rollout of this technology into other strategic markets.


BME continues to advance innovation and diversification, with a strong emphasis on sustainability, regional expansion, and embedding its value proposition within the mining value chain to support its strategic objectives.


Chemicals


- Revenue down 38% to R714 million


- Operating loss down 4% to R22 million


- Operating margin down 55% to (3.1%)


The segment continued to execute its strategy to streamline the business, release capital and improve financial performance sustainably. The integration of the profitable bulk trade business with the Group's manufacturing and supply chain capabilities is underway to unlock operational synergies. Performance was adversely impacted by subdued activity in South Africa's manufacturing and coatings sectors.


New contract wins in South Africa and expanded sales across the broader African market contributed to improved profitability of the Water Care business.


The restructure is expected to be completed in the second half of FY26 with the capital release from the sale of earmarked assets, including the Water Care business, progressing.

South African Revenue Service (SARS)


Omnia is disputing additional tax assessments raised by SARS in respect of its 2014 to 2016 tax years which has culminated in the parties engaging in Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) proceedings in an effort to reach a resolution. While a final resolution to the matter has not yet been reached, the Group continues to engage extensively with SARS and anticipates that the ADR proceedings, which are at an advanced stage, will conclude in the near term. Should the ADR process not result in a satisfactory resolution, the Group will advance its appeal by seeking adjudication by the courts if necessary.
