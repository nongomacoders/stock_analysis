focused on delivering results. Prosus delivered a strong set of results in the first six months to 30 September 2025.

Commentary(1)


Our goal is to build large regional lifestyle ecommerce ecosystems across LatAm, Europe, and India by delivering


outstanding customer experiences, driven by an AI-first approach.


Below is a summary of our key financial highlights:


- Consolidated revenue grew 22% (14%) to US$3.6bn, driven by strong growth from iFood in Latin America (LatAm), OLX in


  Europe, and PayU in India.


- Our bottom line performance accelerated even further, Ecommerce aEBITDA grew 70% (58%) to US$530m, and aEBIT increased


  97% (84%) to US$400m.


- The significant operating improvements across our Ecommerce portfolio drove a 99% (82%) increase in Prosus'


  consolidated aEBITDA, rising from US$213m to US$423m (with consolidated aEBIT improving from US$60m to US$250m).


- Core headline earnings (our measure of after-tax operating performance) grew by 13% (18%) to US$4.0bn, driven by


  strong growth in revenue and profitability of our consolidated Ecommerce businesses and equity accounted investments,


  particularly Tencent. Core headline earnings per share increased by 24% due to the very positive impact of the


  share-repurchase programme. The board considers core headline earnings a useful indicator of the operating performance


  of the group, as it adjusts for non-operational items.


- Earnings from continuing operations increased 23% to US$5.6bn, up from US$4.6bn in the prior period.


- Prosus' free cash flow also improved meaningfully, increasing from US$897m to US$1.3bn. Excluding the Tencent


  dividend, free cash flow was US$59m compared to an outflow of US$104m in 1H25.


During the period, Prosus delivered its financial and operational goals while embracing The Prosus Way, our culture,


that reinforced not only our focus on results, but also on discipline, innovation and our people. We believe we are not


only delivering short-term results but building the foundations for continued growth over a long period.


Our goal is to unlock substantial value by building large regional lifestyle ecommerce ecosystems across LatAm, Europe,


and India by delivering outstanding customer experiences, powered by an AI-first approach. Our ecosystem model now


serves approximately 2 billion consumers worldwide and spans across nearly 100 companies with complementary capabilities.


We see significant headroom to continue growing strongly while expanding profit margins. At our well-received capital


markets day on 25 June 2025, we announced an ambitious three-year plan to at least double Ecommerce revenue and


triple aEBITDA.


While focused on executing our strategy and improving results during the period, we continued to actively manage our


investment portfolio and deploy capital with discipline. In the first six months of the year, we invested US$2.0bn


through mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to boost regional ecosystem growth and profitability, which includes the


acquisition of Despegar in May 2025. In September 2025, Prosus, through OLX, agreed to acquire La Centrale - France's


top motor classifieds platform - for EUR1.1bn (US$1.3bn). This acquisition closed in November and will strengthen OLX's


European portfolio and advance Prosus' ambition to be Europe's leading ecommerce ecosystem. In October, we closed the


transaction to acquire Just Eat Takeaway.com, for approximately EUR4.2bn (US$4.9bn), including additional settlement


arrangements in accordance with the closing conditions. The acquisition advances our ambition to build a European


lifestyle ecosystem and create an AI technology champion in Europe.


We remain disciplined in managing our portfolio by divesting non-strategic businesses and allocating that capital towards


our ecosystem strategy. We divested our stake in Udemy, and other smaller investments, as well as a portion of our stake


in Remitly during the period. Additionally, we trimmed our position in Meituan by US$249m in the period and by a further


US$300m in October. In total, our divestitures for the six months to September and, subsequently through November, have


resulted in total proceeds of US$1.2bn to the group. We expect to divest approximately US$2bn in FY26.


The group has a strong balance sheet of US$20.3bn (US$18.3bn at a central corporate level) cash on hand, including


short-term investments and net cash of US$2.6bn (US$1.8bn at a central corporate level), including interest-bearing loans


and capitalised lease liabilities. The group has committed US$1.3bn for La Centrale and settled EUR5.0bn (US$5.8bn) for the


acquisition of Just Eat Takeaway.com, including the settlement of its convertible bonds for EUR788m (US$925m). This results


in about US$13.2bn (US$11.2bn at a central corporate level) cash on hand. We remain committed to our investment-grade


rating.


Since its inception in June 2022, our share-repurchase programme has reduced the Prosus free-float share count by 30%


and returned over US$41bn of value for Prosus and Naspers shareholders. During this time, the combined holding company


discount of Naspers and Prosus has reduced by 25 percentage points, a result of the repurchase programme as well as


improvements in disclosures and operational execution. This has resulted in US$63bn in value creation through


30 September 2025.


Over the length of the repurchase programme up to 30 September 2025, Prosus has repurchased 892 713 136 of its ordinary N


shares, valued at US$30.1bn, resulting in an incremental accretion of 18% in net asset value (NAV) per share, compared to


what it would have been had the repurchase programme not commenced. Naspers finances its open-ended share-repurchase programme


through regular sales of its Prosus shares. As of 30 September 2025, Naspers had sold 344 868 918 Prosus ordinary N shares


and repurchased 60 735 037 Naspers N ordinary shares, totalling US$11.5bn.


We are committed to disciplined investment in our regional ecosystems and ensuring our operating businesses continue their


strong performance. We believe that this, coupled with our share-repurchase programme, will drive long-term value creation


and enhanced shareholder returns.


We still expect to achieve our 2026 guidance of US$7.3bn - US$7.5bn for Ecommerce revenue and US$1.1bn - US$1.2bn for


Ecommerce aEBITDA, excluding JET. The group is now working hard on integrating JET and finding ways to reinvigorate


growth.


(1) Unless otherwise stated, growth rates discussed in these results compare the first half of the financial year ending


    31 March 2026 (1H26) to the first half of the financial year ending 31 March 2025 (1H25). The percentages/numbers in


    brackets represent local currency growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions and disposals (M&A), and provide a


    clearer view of our businesses' underlying operating performance. Financial results are presented on a continuing


    operations basis.
