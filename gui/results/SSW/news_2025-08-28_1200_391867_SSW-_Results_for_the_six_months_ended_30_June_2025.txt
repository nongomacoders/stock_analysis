MARKET RELEASE


Results for the six months ended 30 June 2025 - Short form announcement


JOHANNESBURG, 28 August 2025: Sibanye-Stillwater (JSE: SSW and NYSE: SBSW) is pleased to report operating and financial results for the six


months ended 30 June 2025 (H1 2025).


SALIENT FEATURES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2025

1.    The Group reports adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) based on the formula included in the facility agreements for compliance with the debt


      covenant. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance under IFRS and should be considered in


      addition to and not as a substitute for any other measure of financial performance and liquidity. For a reconciliation of profit before royalties and tax to adjusted EBITDA,


      see note 11.1 of the consolidated interim financial statements


2.    The US PGM operations' underground production is converted to metric tonnes and kilograms, and financial performance is translated to SA rand (rand). In addition to the US PGM operations'


      underground production, the operation treats various recycling material which is excluded from the 2E PGM production, average basket price and All-in sustaining cost statistics shown. PGM


      recycling represents palladium, platinum and rhodium ounces fed to the furnace


3.    The Platinum Group Metals (PGM) production in the SA operations is principally platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold, referred to as 4E (3PGM+Au) and measured at the concentrator, and in


      the US underground operations is principally platinum and palladium, referred to as 2E (2PGM) and US PGM recycling is principally platinum, palladium and rhodium referred to as 3E (3PGM)


4.    See "Salient features and cost benchmarks - Six months" for the definition of All-in sustaining cost (AISC). The SA PGM All-in sustaining cost excludes the production and costs


      associated with the purchase of concentrate (PoC) from third parties


5.    The acquisition of the Reldan Group of Companies (Reldan) was concluded on 15 March 2024. The six months ended 30 June 2024 only includes the results since acquisition


6.    The SA PGM production excludes the production associated with the PoC from third parties. For a reconciliation of the production and third party PoC,


      refer to the "Reconciliation of operating cost excluding third party PoC for Total SA PGM operations and Marikana - Six months"


7.    Payable Zinc production is the payable quantity of zinc metal produced after applying smelter content deductions


8.    Average equivalent zinc concentrate price is the total zinc sales revenue recognised at the price expected to be received excluding the fair value adjustments divided by the payable zinc


      metal sold


9.    Adjusted EBITDA and AISC are not measures of performance under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for measures of financial performance prepared in


      accordance with IFRS. See "Non-IFRS measures" for more information on the Non-IFRS metrics presented by Sibanye-Stillwater


10.   The US PGM operations' All-in sustaining cost for the six months ended 31 December 2024 and 30 June 2024 were adjusted to include the Section 45X (S45X) Advance Manufacturing Production


      Credits. During the six months ended 30 June 2025 the US PGM operations recognised R699 million (US$39 million) and R563 million (US$30 million) which related to mining costs for


      the six months ended 31 December 2024 and 30 June 2024, respectively

OVERVIEW OF THE RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2025


The Group operating and financial performance for H1 2025 was pleasing, with safe production and costs from the operations consistent, and


largely in line with the intended outcomes of the operational restructuring undertaken from mid-2023.


Greater operational stability and good cost control at most Group operations, combined with leveraged exposure of the SA gold operations to


the rand gold price has notably improved Group profitability for H1 2025.


The positive financial outcomes from solid operational management and decisive restructuring, were amplified by the incorporation of Section 45X


credits in terms of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), following agreements reached with third party refiners of our PGMs. A total S45X credit of R5.1


billion (US$285 million) (comprising combined estimated credits for 2023, 2024 and H1 2025), has been recognised in cost of sales for the US PGM


mining and recycling operations for the period, benefiting cost and boosting profitability for H1 2025, with associated cash payments expected in


2026.


Improved operational profitability and cash flow, together with effective balance sheet management and reinforcement measures implemented


during 2024, has enhanced the Group financial position, and I am satisfied that the Group is well positioned to thrive under multiple scenarios and


to create ongoing shared value for stakeholders.


SAFE PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE


I am particularly pleased with the continued improvement in most of the Group's key safety statistics and performance, especially while navigating


a challenging environment and through a disruptive period of restructuring and change.


The Group Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) of 3.90 per million hours worked for H1 2025 was 12% lower than for H1 2024 and was the


lowest level reached for TRIFR since we began tracking it in 2020. Group Serious Injury Frequency Rate (SIFR) and TRIFR have both shown


favourable compound annual declines of 14% and 16% respectively over the past 3 1/2 years. The Group Fatal Injury Frequency Rate (FIFR) for H1


2025 of 0.038 improved by 5% year-on-year (H1 2024 of 0.04) and was 24% lower than the 3-year trailing FIFR, representing a sustained


improvement in safety across the Group since 2022.


Despite the general reduction in the Group lagging indicators, the loss of three colleagues from the SA region during H1 2025 (H1 2024: 3) is an


ongoing reminder that we still have a challenging journey to achieve our goal of zero harm. We mourn the tragic loss of these employees and will


continue to focus on the implementation of our fatal elimination strategy to maintain our safe production focus.


OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND OPTIMISING PROFITABILITY


All Group operations other than the SA gold operations are on track to deliver safe production and unit costs within annual guidance ranges for


2025, as well as improved profitability. Only the SA gold operations fell short of planned production and cost levels, but continued to benefit from


leverage to the increasing gold price during H1 2025, delivering a significantly improved financial contribution.


The SA PGM operations continued to deliver steady and reliable results, as they have done consistently since they were acquired and integrated


into the Group. Since 2016, the SA PGM operations have met or exceeded annual guidance every year, other than in 2022, when unanticipated


stage 6 load shedding by Eskom from September 2022 severely disrupted the entire SA mining industry.


Production from the SA PGM operations (including attributable production from Mimosa and purchase of concentrates (PoC)) for H1 2025 was 4%


lower year-on-year due to surface production declining by 30% year-on-year, primarily due to heavy rainfall during Q1 2025 which disrupted PGM


production throughout the SA PGM industry. Underground production was flat year-on-year.


Adjusted EBITDA from the SA PGM operations of R4.8 billion (US$260 million) for H1 2025 was in line with H1 2024, despite 151,863 4Eoz (16%) less 4E


PGM sold year-on-year. A 7% higher average basket price received for H1 2025 offset lower metal sales. The inventory built-up during H1 2025, is


expected to be processed and sold in H2 2025. Compared with H2 2024, adjusted EBITDA for H1 2025 was 81% higher, primarily driven by a 10%


increase in the average 4E basket price.


The restructuring of the US PGM operations during Q4 2024 was successfully implemented, with production and cost for H1 2025 ahead of planned


restructuring levels and, on an annualised basis, better than 2025 guidance.


The profitability of the US PGM operations also improved despite lower metal sales due to a build-up of inventory during the smelter transition in Q2


2025 and an average 2E PGM basket price for H1 2025, that was less than 1% higher than for H1 2024. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted EBITDA


(excluding S45X credits) for H1 2025 improved by US$8 million (R273 million) to a loss of US$9 million (R51 million), compared with an adjusted EBITDA


loss of US$16 million (R324 million) for H1 2024 (excluding the once off US$43 million (R812 million) insurance payment during Q1 2024, related to the


mid-2022 flooding event).


The average 2E PGM basket price for Q3 2025 to date is US$1,229/2Eoz. This is 25% higher than the average for H1 2025 of US$985/oz and 9% below


AISC (excluding S45X credits) of US$1,351/oz. Similarly to the SA PGM operations, if higher PGM prices persist, the profitability of the US PGM


operations should increase substantially.


During Q2 2025, agreement was reached with the contract refiner with both parties signing certification statements reflecting this agreement.


Consequently, total S45X credits of US$159 million (R2.8 billion) for the PGM underground operations, were recognised during Q2 2025, comprising a


credit against cost of US$20 million (R360 million)) for H1 2025 and full year credits of US$70 million (R1.2 billion) and US$69 million (R1.2 billion) for


2023 and 2024 respectively, significantly benefiting cost and profitability for the US PGM operations for the period.


Adjusted EBITDA for the US PGM operations including just the H1 2025 S45X credit of US$20 million (R360 million), would have increased to US$11


million (R309 million). Combined with the full S45X credits for 2023 and 2024, adjusted EBITDA for the US PGM operations increased substantially to


US$151 million (R2.8 billion) for H1 2025, 457% higher than for H1 2024.


The SA gold operations are highly leveraged to the dollar gold price and rand:dollar exchange rate. Despite operational challenges which


reduced production by 13% year-on-year, adjusted EBITDA for H1 2025 increased by 118% to R4.8 billion (US$260 million) from R2.2 billion (US$117


million) for H1 2024, driven by a 36% year-on-year increase in the average received gold price to R1,802,580/kg (US$3,049/oz). This is the highest


adjusted EBITDA from the SA gold operations since H2 2020, and accordingly, the contribution from the SA gold operations to Group adjusted


EBITDA for H1 2025 (excluding total S45X credits) increased to 48% from 33% for H1 2024, confirming the strategic importance of the SA gold assets


in the diversified Group portfolio.


Gold production from the managed SA gold operations (excluding DRDGOLD) decreased by 14% primarily due to ongoing challenges at the


Kloof operation, with AISC for H1 2025, increasing by 17% due to 21% lower gold sold year-on-year.


The average gold price received by the SA managed operations for H1 2025 (including gold hedges), increased by 33% to R1,756,996/kg


(US$2,972/oz), significantly enhancing operational profitability. Adjusted EBITDA (excluding DRDGOLD) increased by 166% to R3.0 billion (US$160


million) compared to R1.1 billion (US$59 million) in H1 2024.


The Century zinc retreatment operations in the Australian region also performed strongly, with production 22% higher year-on-year and AISC 22%


lower. Adjusted EBITDA of R657 million (US$36 million) for H1 2025 was a substantial turnaround from the adjusted EBITDA loss for H1 2024 of R351


million (US$19 million), reflecting an all-round good performance and greater operational stability through measures implemented to sustain


production through the wet season that had affected production in previous years.


The US PGM recycling operation was stable year-on-year, with recycling constrained by low automobile scrappage rates. The average 3E PGM


recycling basket price of US$1,311/3Eoz (R24,109/3Eoz) for H1 2025 was 5% higher than for H1 2024, partially offsetting 14% lower 3E PGM ounces


sold due to a build up of inventory during the smelter transition.


As a result of lower 3E sales (and build up in inventory), on a like-for like basis, adjusted EBITDA (excluding S45X credits) of US$4 million (R150 million)


was 55% lower year-on-year. Excess inventory is expected to be processed and sold during H2 2025 and, benefiting from higher average PGM


prices for Q3 2025 to date, boosting revenue for the coming period.


The US PGM recycling operations also qualify for S45X credits, which boosted adjusted EBITDA for H1 2025 by US$121 million (R2.2 billion) to US$129


million (R2.4 billion). The total credits of US$126 million (R2.2 billion) comprised US$16 million (R289 million) for H1 2025, US$40 million (R711 million) for


2024 and US$69 million (R1.2 billion) for 2023.


The Reldan recycling operation generated adjusted EBITDA of US$18 million (R330 million) for H1 2025, 20% higher than for H2 2024, the previous full


6-month period since it was incorporated into the Group in March 2024. Revenues benefited from higher gold and silver prices during the period.


In our EU region, the ramp down of the Sandouville refinery is nearing completion and preparation for the care and maintenance phase is


ongoing. Production of nickel cathode and nickel salts from nickel matte was stopped by end of Q2 and only some areas of the down stream


process remain open to allow for recycling and recovery of nickel from the effluents. Adjusted EBITDA losses of R310 million (US$17 million) for H1


2025 are expected to reduce once the operations are on care and maintenance.


The GalliCam project prefeasibility study is expected to be completed around year end.


The Keliber lithium project remains on track for completion of the construction phase during H1 2026. 2025 marks the peak of project capital


expenditure, with capital commitments forecast to decline significantly from H1 2026.


The Keliber lithium project remains the most advanced, fully integrated lithium hydroxide project in the EU region, offering a significant competitive


advantage for value realisation in a more supportive price environment. In light of revisions to medium term lithium market fundamentals and


price forecasts, we are currently assessing various scenarios to ensure that a decision on the full commissioning and production build up, is


adequately informed and responsible, with a primary focus on timing of market entry to optimise value.


FINANCIAL HEALTH


The Group is in a sound financial position. Balance sheet ratios are healthy, secured by capital reinforcement and disciplined capital allocation


during 2024, underpinned by improving operational profitability and cash flows. With precious metals prices well supported, the projected outlook


for key financial health indicators is positive.


Greater operational stability and good cost control from most Group operations, combined with the leveraged exposure of our SA gold operations


to the increasing gold price, have notably improved Group profitability.


Importantly, this upward trend in Group profitability reflects the benefits of repositioning and restructuring of operations which stabilised production


and cost from most Group operations, which underpinned a 51% increase in Group adjusted EBITDA (excluding all S45X credits) to R10.0 billion


(US$533 million) for H1 2025 from adjusted EBITDA of R6.6 billion (US$355 million) for H1 2024.


The financial turnaround for H1 2025 was significantly amplified by the incorporation of Advance Manufacturing Production credits in terms of


Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which have been secured for the US PGM operations following agreement reached with the US


PGM third party refiner.


S45X credits for both the US underground and recycling operations for FY2023, FY2024 and H1 2025 totalling R5.1 billion (US$285 million) were


recognised during Q2 2025, boosting Group adjusted EBITDA (including S45X credits) to R15.1 billion (US$818 million), 127% higher than adjusted


EBITDA of R6.6 billion (US$355 million) for H1 2024, albeit not directly comparable year-on-year.


The same positive trend was reflected in Group adjusted free cash flow (FCF), which improved by R12.4 billion (US$610 million) to positive FCF of


R4.5 billion (US$243 million) for H1 2025, from a free cash outflow of R6.9 billion (US$367 million) for H1 2024.


Group FCF was boosted by the R9.2 billion (US$500 million) proceeds from the Franco Nevada streaming transaction, concluded in February 2025.


Excluding the streaming proceeds would have resulted in a R4.7 billion (US$258 million) FCF outflow for the Group for H1 2025. This is still substantially


improved compared with H1 2024, despite the substantial buildup of inventory at the gold and PGM operations which reduced metal sales and


FCF from these operations during H1 2025. This inventory is expected to be processed during H2 2025, enhancing cash flow for the period.


The Group's cash balance (excluding Burnstone) increased by 31% from 31 December 2024 to R21.0 billion (US$1.1 billion) at 30 June 2025, primarily


due to the streaming proceeds.


Gross debt (excluding Burnstone) increased by 2% to R40.2 billion (US$2.3 billion) at 30 June 2025, primarily due to project capital expenditure at


the Keliber Lithium project.


Net debt decreased by R4.2 billion (US169 million) to R19.2 billion (US$1.1 million) at 30 June 2025, which together with the a 64% increase in the 12


month trailing adjusted EBITDA to R21.5 billion (US$1.2 billion), resulted in the Group's net debt to adjusted EBITDA reducing to 0.89x, which is


pleasing considering substantial capital investment in key projects through the price cycle.


The Group financial position is robust, with sufficient balance sheet liquidity headroom of R46.9bn (US$2.6bn), debt maturities which are well


structured and undemanding, Group net debt:adjusted EBITDA which is within comfort levels and well below debt covenant levels. SA gold and


SA PGM operations are expected to deliver improved operating results during H2 2025. Metal sales for the period are likely to be enhanced by a


release of inventory built up during H1 2025. The US PGM operations are similarly expected to benefit from a release of inventory and higher metal


sales for H2 2025.


The SA gold operations and SA and US PGM operations are highly leveraged to metal prices as is evident from the sharp increase in profitability for


H1 2025, despite relatively modest metal price increases. Gold and PGM prices have rallied further during Q3 2025 (for Q3 2025 to date, averaging


R1,934,171/kg (+5%), R31,328/4Eoz (+19%) and US$1,229/2Eoz (+25%)), which suggests significant upside for earnings and cash flow should higher


prices be maintained.


The Group cash position will be further enhanced in 2026, by the expected R4,404 million (US$248.5 million) S45X credits cash payment to the US


PGM operations.


Losses from the Sandouville refinery are also anticipated to decline when the facility is placed on planned care and maintenance at year end.


Furthermore, as detailed in the Q1 2025 operating results, Group cash flow is expected to benefit from substantially reduced annual project capital


expenditure for the Keliber lithium project (from capital guidance of ?300 million (R5.9 billion) for 2025), following the forecast completion of the


construction/development phase of the Keliber lithium project, scheduled for H1 2026.


The Marikana K4 shaft is also nearing completion of the project phase, with project capital expected to decline from current levels of R309 million


(US$17 million) for H1 2025, and its contribution to revenue from the Marikana operation, increasing as production continues to ramp up.


As such, there is a high probability that cash flow for H2 2025 and FY2026 could increase substantially, supporting a reduction in Gross debt, which


will further strengthen the Group financial position, and provide for increased dividends to shareholders.


STRATEGIC POSITIONING


I am confident that the proactive and decisive actions taken over the past 2 years to optimise operational profitability and secure the financial


sustainability of the Group through an extended trough in commodity prices, have successfully managed risk and aided in preserving value.


The decisions we took and actions we implemented were not taken lightly, but were deeply considered and measured, avoiding knee-jerk


responses to the deteriorating environment, before being decisively implemented.


We approached the restructuring in a phased and considered manner, focusing on high-cost mines to restore profitability and ensure their survival,


and closing shafts which were at, or close to, the end of their operating lives, or unable to restructure effectively.


Our strategic positioning in the US, European and Australian ecosystems has been guided by our recognition in 2021 that the global trade model


was unsustainable and that there would be a shift towards establishment of regional value chains, which we called multipolarity. We anticipated


that achieving greater trade independence would require significant financial support and investment from regional governments, which would


benefit strategically positioned businesses.


This led to us keeping the US PGM operations in production at reduced scale despite sentiment from some analysts and investors that they should


be shut down. I am pleased to say this appears to be the right decision by the Group. The US PGM operations are the only source of primary PGM


supply in the US and are of strategic importance not just for Sibanye-Stillwater, but for the US. The phased repositioning and restructuring we


implemented at these operations since 2022, together with the S45X credits, which will provide critical financial support for the next 8 years, has


already enhanced their potential sustainability.


The Group filed anti-dumping and countervailing duty petitions on unwrought Palladium from Russia on 30 July 2025, following significant


engagement with the US Treasury. The petition was filed together with the United Steelworkers Union and with support from over 70% of US


Palladium value chain participants.


The purpose of US anti-dumping and countervailing duty law is to ensure that domestic producers can compete on a level playing field by


addressing market distortions caused by unfair trade practices. Parallel investigations by the US Department of Commerce and the US


International Trade Commission will take about 13 months although preliminary duties may be imposed within five months of the filing.


The rationale for our application is to protect a strategic asset for the US and protect our US PGM operations from uneven trade practices, for the


benefit of stakeholders including employees and communities in Montana.


Our projects in the European region, the Keliber lithium project and GalliCam project, have both been granted 'strategic project' status under the


EU critical raw materials act (CRMA), with the GalliCam project having been awarded a conditional grant of ?144 million from the European


Innovation Fund.


While taking decisive action to improve operational profitability and reinforce our Balance sheet, and despite the trough in prices, we continued


to invest in key projects that were approved and were under development, such as the Marikana K4 project and the Keliber lithium project. Both


of these projects are well advanced, with the K4 project in the production buildup phase, with project capital expenditure reducing, and the


Keliber lithium project nearing completion of the construction phase.


The K4 project at Marikana operations is a world class PGM project with a LOM of more than 30 years that was substantially developed with


capital invested by Lonmin before it was put on care and maintenance in 2015/16. Sibanye-Stillwater resumed project development in 2021 and it


has significantly advanced, with the ramp up of production to full production of 250,000 4Eoz underway for three years already, steadily increasing


its contribution to Marikana production and reducing unit costs.


The Keliber lithium project remains the most advanced, fully integrated lithium hydroxide project in the EU region, offering a significant competitive


advantage for value realisation by supplying locally mined and beneficiated critical metals to the European battery ecosystem.


The lithium market has been in surplus since 2023, which has continued to weigh on lithium prices during H1 2025. Despite lithium prices falling well


into the industry cost curve, there has been limited response from producers. Absent any material supply response, the lithium market is forecast to


remain in surplus for longer, extending the trough in prices. Despite a slowdown in forecast battery electric vehicles (BEV) sales growth, lithium


demand is expected to continue to increase steadily, albeit at a reduced rate than previously projected by the market. Our fundamental long-


term outlook for the lithium market therefore remains unchanged, however these factors have contributed to a more extended period of


oversupply and low prices, than previously forecast.


We successfully funded these projects through peak capex phases, while maintaining our financial integrity, contrary to expectations of many


market commentators. Project capital requirements for these projects are forecast to decrease significantly during 2026, enhancing cash flow.


Further to investing in these key projects through the cycle, opportunities to optimise the potential of the SA PGM operations continue to be


assessed.


The acquisition of Valterra's 50% share in the Kroondal PSA and full consolidation of Kroondal into the Rustenburg operation during H2 2024, allows


opportunities for further synergies and value unlock, in addition to the cross boundary mining already taking place. During Q2 2025, the Board


approved the Bambanani-Siphumelele project as the next step in realising value from this acquisition. This brownfield project involves the extension


of the Bambanani decline allowing extraction of Siphumelele UG2 reserves from low cost mechanised Bambanani infrastructure. The Siphumelele


vertical shaft provides more efficient man and materials logistics resulting in significant cost benefits for both operations. This logical, relatively low


capital intensity project, is expected to deliver extend the life of both the Siphumelele and Bambanani mines, and forecast to deliver quick


payback of invested capital, thereby ensuring high returns for the Group and unlocking of shared value for all stakeholders.


Low capital intensity,brownfields projects such as this are a logical continuation of the consolidation of our SA PGM assets which began in 2016


and offer significant potential to maintain higher production from these assets over a longer LOM than currently planned, through the realisation of


further operational and cost synergies. There is also significant potential to reprocess extensive surface resources, which is currently being assessed


and is expected to extend the life of the surface operations significantly.


The agreement announced on 19 February 2025 regarding the Glencore/Merafe JV is expected to significantly increase chrome yields and


production from the SA PGM operations, and accelerate completion of delivery of contracted chrome volumes agreed in 2011 between Lonmin


and the Glencore/Merafe JV Venture, by approximately 20 years. Thereafter, Sibanye-Stillwater's attributable share of value from chrome


production from the Marikana CRPs is expected to be significantly enhanced from greater exposure to chrome prices, and anticipated future


chrome production growth. The improved economics of Sibanye-Stillwater's chrome production are expected to enhance the inherent value and


commercial viability of development and extension brownfields projects at the SA PGM operations, which are currently being assessed.

DIVIDEND DECLARATION


Despite normalised earnings of R1,832 million for the six months ended 30 June 2025, the Board has decided to maintain a more prudent and


conservative approach considering the uncertain global economic and geo-political backdrop and resolved not to declare an interim dividend


for 2025. A decision on an appropriate full year dividend for 2025, will instead be made by the Board of Directors after assessing the financial results


for the year ending 31 December 2025 together with the prevailing operating context. No dividends were declared for 2024.
