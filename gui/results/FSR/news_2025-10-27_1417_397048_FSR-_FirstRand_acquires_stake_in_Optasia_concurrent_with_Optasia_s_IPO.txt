FIRSTRAND ACQUIRES STAKE IN OPTASIA CONCURRENT WITH OPTASIA'S IPO


FirstRand today informs shareholders that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire


20.1% of Channel VAS Investments Limited ("Channel VAS Investments or Optasia"), one of the


world's largest AI-powered fintech platforms providing financial access to people across emerging


markets. FirstRand refers to the SENS issued by Channel VAS Investments for full details of the


transaction.


FirstRand believes that this strategic investment in Optasia represents an exciting opportunity to


leverage a proven fintech platform that has a successful track record of solving the lending needs of


underbanked or unbanked consumers which have had difficulty accessing traditional credit products.


Optasia's ability to pre-score customers, process micro loans at scale and use mobile data sales as a


credit collection mechanism is highly innovative and is clearly meeting the needs of millions of


customers in 38 countries across Africa, the Middle East and Asia. FirstRand believes that the group's


retail and business bank First National Bank will be in a strong position to leverage this platform to


accelerate its own strategy to grow in segments in South Africa where it is underrepresented, such as


entry level client cohorts, and markets in its broader Africa portfolio.


Optasia's business model and strategy represents significant growth opportunities both in terms of


geographic expansion, new product development and other banking, funding and treasury solutions.


The transaction is not a categorisation transaction in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements and is


therefore a voluntary announcement.
