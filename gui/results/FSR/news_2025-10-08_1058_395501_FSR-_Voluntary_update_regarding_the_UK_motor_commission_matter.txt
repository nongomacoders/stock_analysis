VOLUNTARY UPDATE REGARDING THE UK MOTOR COMMISSION MATTER


FirstRand notes the statement and consultative paper published by the UK's Financial Conduct


Authority (FCA) on 7 October 2025 describing the scope and nature of a proposed redress scheme (the


scheme) relating to commission practices in the UK motor finance industry. Whilst more time is


required to fully review the statement, the group's initial view is that the scheme appears to have


moved beyond the group's expectations of what can be considered proportionate or reasonable.


In addition, the presumptions of unfairness in the scheme in its current form does not appear to be


applying the legal clarity provided by the recent UK Supreme Court, which stated that unfairness


should be assessed on a combination of multiple, specific facts.


FirstRand undertakes to consult with the FCA as soon as possible to better understand the above issues


and also to gain clarification on some data inconsistencies included in the consultative paper. Once the


group has more clarity regarding its next steps, which could be earlier than the six week period set out


by the FCA, it will immediately update shareholders.
