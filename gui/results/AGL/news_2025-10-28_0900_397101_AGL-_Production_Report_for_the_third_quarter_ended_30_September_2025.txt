Notes:


Anglo American is a leading global mining company focused on the responsible production of copper, premium iron ore


and crop nutrients - future-enabling products that are essential for decarbonising the global economy, improving living


standards, and food security. Our portfolio of world-class operations and outstanding resource endowments offers


value-accretive growth potential across all three businesses, positioning us to deliver into structurally attractive major


demand growth trends.


Our integrated approach to sustainability and innovation drives our decision-making across the value chain, from how


we discover new resources to how we mine, process, move and market our products to our customers - safely, efficiently


and responsibly. Our Sustainable Mining Plan commits us to a series of stretching goals over different time horizons to


ensure we contribute to a healthy environment, create thriving communities and build trust as a corporate leader. We


work together with our business partners and diverse stakeholders to unlock enduring value from precious natural


resources for our shareholders, for the benefit of the communities and countries in which we operate, and for society as a


whole. Anglo American is re-imagining mining to improve people's lives.


Anglo American is currently implementing a number of major structural changes to unlock the inherent value in its


portfolio and thereby accelerate delivery of its strategic priorities of Operational excellence, Portfolio simplification, and


Growth. This portfolio transformation is focusing Anglo American on its world-class resource asset base in copper,


premium iron ore and crop nutrients - once the sale of our steelmaking coal and nickel businesses and the separation of


our iconic diamond business (De Beers) have been completed.

Forward-looking statements and third-party information:


This announcement includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts


included in this document, including, without limitation, those regarding Anglo American's financial position, business,


acquisition and divestment strategy, dividend policy, plans and objectives of management for future operations,


prospects and projects (including development plans and objectives relating to Anglo American's products, production


forecasts and Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource positions) and sustainability performance related (including


environmental, social and governance) goals, ambitions, targets, visions, milestones and aspirations, are forward-looking


statements. By their nature, such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other


factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Anglo American or industry results to be


materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking


statements.


Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Anglo American's present and future


business strategies and the environment in which Anglo American will operate in the future. Important factors that could


cause Anglo American's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-


looking statements include, among others, levels of actual production during any period, levels of global demand and


product prices, unanticipated downturns in business relationships with customers or their purchases from Anglo


American, mineral resource exploration and project development capabilities and delivery, recovery rates and other


operational capabilities, safety, health or environmental incidents, the effects of global pandemics and outbreaks of


infectious diseases, the impact of attacks from third parties on our information systems, natural catastrophes or adverse


geological conditions, climate change and extreme weather events, the outcome of litigation or regulatory proceedings,


the availability of mining and processing equipment, the ability to obtain key inputs in a timely manner, the ability to


produce and transport products profitably, the availability of necessary infrastructure (including transportation) services,


the development, efficacy and adoption of new or competing technology, challenges in realising resource estimates or


discovering new economic mineralisation, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and operating


costs, the availability of sufficient credit, liquidity and counterparty risks, the effects of inflation, terrorism, war, conflict,


political or civil unrest, uncertainty, tensions and disputes and economic and financial conditions around the world,


evolving societal and stakeholder requirements and expectations, shortages of skilled employees, unexpected difficulties


relating to acquisitions or divestitures, competitive pressures and the actions of competitors, activities by courts,


regulators and governmental authorities such as in relation to permitting or forcing closure of mines and ceasing of


operations or maintenance of Anglo American's assets and changes in taxation or safety, health, environmental or other


types of regulation in the countries where Anglo American operates, conflicts over land and resource ownership rights


and such other risk factors identified in Anglo American's most recent Annual Report. Forward-looking statements should,


therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking


statements.


These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this document. Anglo American expressly disclaims any

forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Anglo American's expectations with regard thereto


or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

match or exceed its historical published earnings per share. Certain statistical and other information included in this


document is sourced from third-party sources (including, but not limited to, externally conducted studies and trials). As
