Operational update for the quarter ended September 2025


This voluntary announcement serves to update shareholders on the


Group's first quarter period ended September 2025 ("the first quarter",


"the period").


The Group increased sales for the first quarter by 8.0%.


On a net basis, the Group opened 81 stores during the first quarter.


The majority of these, a net 72 stores, were opened in our core


South African supermarkets segment around which our Group-wide ecosystem


strategy is built.


The table below outlines sales growth by operating segment:


Sales growth from continuing operations for the three months

Group                                                                    8.0


By segment:


Supermarkets RSA                                                         7.9


Supermarkets Non-RSA                                                    12.9


Other operating segments                                                 4.8


Supermarkets RSA


The Group's core Supermarkets RSA segment, the majority of which is


represented by our food retail operations Shoprite, Usave, Checkers,


Checkers Hyper and LiquorShop increased sales for the first quarter by


7.9% (prior period first quarter: 11.4%). This growth reflects continued


out-performance compared to rest-of-market growth by a factor of 1.7x as


measured by NielsenIQ.


Our Supermarkets RSA segment's selling price inflation has continued to


decrease from the 1.8% selling price inflation as previously reported for


July 2025. For the quarter under review, selling price inflation was 1.4%


(prior period first quarter: 2.6%). This is a notable divergence from that


reported by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) food and non-alcoholic


beverages inflation which averaged 5.1% for the period. Notably, for the


month of September 2025, selling price inflation in our price fighting


banners, Shoprite and Usave, was 0% and negative 0.4%, respectively. Within


this sustained low inflation context, the business remains vigilant in terms


of cost growth management.


Supermarkets RSA opened a net 72 stores during the first quarter


(79 openings, 7 closures) with new store openings made up of 38 supermarkets


(10 Checkers, 15 Shoprite, 13 Usave), 22 LiquorShops and 19 adjacent formats


(12 Petshop Science, four Uniq clothing by Checkers, two Checkers Outdoor


and one Little Me).


Supermarkets Non-RSA


The Group's Supermarkets Non-RSA operating segment, trading in seven


countries outside South Africa, increased sale of merchandise for the first


quarter by 10.9% in constant currency and by 12.9% (prior period first


quarter as reported: 3.2%) in our reporting currency, the rand.


Supermarkets Non-RSA opened three new stores during the first quarter: one


Shoprite and two LiquorShop.


Other operating segments


The Group's Other operating segments reported a 4.8% increase in sales


(prior period first quarter: 10.2%).


Our Medirite business increased sales by 12.3% for the period, ending the


quarter with 118 in-store dispensaries and 21 Medirite Plus stand-alone drug


stores (prior period first quarter: 16). The Group's pharmaceutical


distributor, Transpharm, increased sales by 2.7%, impacted by relocating to


its new highly automated Johannesburg distribution centre.


Sales to our OK Franchise division increased by 4.3% (prior period first


quarter: 13.6%). The OK Franchise division opened a net three stores during


the first quarter, ending with 618 stores.


Additional information


The Group successfully concluded the sale of our non-RSA furniture


businesses, classified as held for sale, effective 1 October 2025. The


proceeds are expected to be received during our 2026 second half period.


With regards to the remaining RSA furniture business held for sale, the


required competition approval process is ongoing and updates will be


provided in due course.


Next reporting date


The Group intends to issue its 2026 interim period sales update by the end


of February 2026 and will report its 2026 interim results during March 2026.


Further details in terms of reporting dates, as they are finalised, will be


available on the Group's Shareholder diary on the Company's corporate


website.


The information contained in this announcement has not been reviewed or


reported on by the Group's external auditors.
