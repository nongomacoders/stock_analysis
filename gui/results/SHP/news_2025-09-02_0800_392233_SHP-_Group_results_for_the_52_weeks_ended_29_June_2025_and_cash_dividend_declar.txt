Group results for the 52 weeks ended 29 June 2025 and cash dividend


declaration


Pieter Engelbrecht, Chief Executive Officer:


This year the Group achieved an impressive milestone by surpassing the


R250 billion sales mark, with sales growth of R20.6 billion for the period.


Prioritising our customers, we returned R16.5 billion at point of sale while


successfully maintaining our selling price inflation at only 2.3% in our


core Supermarkets RSA segment.


Our businesses excelled in providing top-tier pricing, availability and


compelling promotions. Achieving this across 2 863 corporate-owned stores is


a testament to the expertise and dedication of our teams, who diligently


executed our market-leading strategy that focuses on the daily needs of our


more than 30 million customers.


In terms of sales performance in our core Supermarkets RSA segment, the


Shoprite and Usave brands saw a sales increase of 5.9%, translating to


R6.5 billion in sales growth from a substantial base of R110.1 billion.


Recognising the economic pressures our customers face, we managed to keep


Shoprite's pricing inflation below 2%. Our commitment to operational


discipline allowed us to enhance gross margins despite higher promotional


levels.


Checkers continued to thrive, with sales growth of 13.8%, adding


R11.6 billion to reach almost R100 billion in sales. With 350 supermarkets,


including 40 Checkers Hyper stores, we believe Checkers' vision to


democratise premium food retail has significant untapped potential in


South Africa.


Our on-demand delivery platform, Sixty60, again achieved phenomenal


growth with sales increasing by 47.7% to measure R18.9 billion.


We continued executing on our strategy to focus on growing the businesses


that form part of our core Supermarkets RSA and in doing so we reduced


exposure in certain Non-RSA regions whilst also, selling our furniture


business to Pepkor Holdings Ltd.


Looking ahead, our focus remains on developing an omnichannel retail


platform to enhance our customer experience. We've launched new online


shopping options, including the Checkers transactional website and updated


Sixty60 app, extending our delivery services across other retail categories


and formats.


We are proud of our achievements and grateful to our 168 000 employees for


their contributions to our success. To our valued customers, thank you for


your continued support. We are excited about the future and look forward to


further growth and investment for the benefit of all stakeholders.
