As at 30 September 2025, Fairvest held a 79.9% interest (2024: 0%) in Onepath Investments (RF)

Declaration of dividend for the six months ended 30 September 2025


The Board has resolved to declare a final dividend (dividend number 21) of 72.91527 cents per A share,


and 25.04395 cents per B share, being 100% of the distributable income for the period (2024: 100%).


The dividend will be paid to shareholders in accordance with the timetable set out below:


                                                                                                2025


 Last date to trade cum distribution                                             Friday, 19 December


 Shares trade ex-distribution                                                    Monday, 22 December


 Record date                                                                  Wednesday, 24 December


 Payment date                                                                    Monday, 29 December


Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Monday, 22 December 2025 and


Wednesday, 24 December 2025, both days inclusive. Payment of the dividend will be made to


shareholders on Monday, 29 December 2025. In respect of dematerialised shareholders, the dividend


will be transferred to the Central Securities Depositary Participant ("CSDP") accounts/broker accounts


on Monday, 29 December 2025. Certificated shareholders' dividend payments will be deposited on or


about Monday, 29 December 2025 to certificated shareholders' bank accounts.


In accordance with Fairvest's status as a REIT, shareholders are advised that the dividends meet the


requirements of a "qualifying distribution" for the purposes of section 25BB of the Income Tax Act, No.


58 of 1962 ("Income Tax Act"). The distributions on the shares will be deemed to be a dividend, for


South African tax purposes, in terms of section 25BB of the Income Tax Act.


The dividend received by or accrued to South African tax residents must be included in the gross income


of such shareholders and will not be exempt from income tax (in terms of the exclusion to the general


dividend exemption, contained in paragraph (aa) of section 10(1)(k)(i) of the Income Tax Act) because


they are dividends distributed by a REIT. These dividends are, however, exempt from dividend


withholding tax in the hands of South African tax resident shareholders, provided that the South African


resident shareholders provided the following forms to their CSDP or broker, as the case may be, in


respect of uncertificated shares, or the Company, in respect of certificated shares:


a)   a declaration that the dividend is exempt from dividends tax; and


b)   a written undertaking to inform the CSDP, broker or the Company should the circumstances


     affecting the exemption change or the beneficial owner cease to be the beneficial owner,


     both in the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service.


     Shareholders are advised to contact their CSDP, broker or the Company to arrange for the


     abovementioned documents to be submitted prior to payment of the dividend if such documents


     have not already been submitted.


Dividends received by non-resident shareholders will not be taxable as income and instead will be treated


as ordinary dividends which are exempt from income tax in terms of the general dividend exemption in


section 10(1)(k)(i) of the Income Tax Act. Dividends withholding tax is 20% and accordingly, any


dividends received by a non-resident from a REIT will be subject to dividend withholding tax at 20%,


unless the rate is reduced in terms of any applicable agreement for the avoidance of double taxation


("DTA") between South Africa and the country of residence of the shareholders. Assuming dividend


withholding tax will be withheld at a rate of 20%, the net dividend amount due to non-resident


shareholders in respect of the final dividend per A share is 58.33222 cents per A share. The net dividend


amount due to non-resident shareholders in respect of the final dividend per B share is 20.03516 cents


per B share. A reduced dividend withholding rate in terms of the applicable DTA, may only be relied on


if the non-resident shareholder has provided the following forms to their CSDP or broker in respect of


uncertificated shares, or the Company, in respect of certificated shares:


a)   a declaration that the dividends are subject to a reduced rate as a result of the application of a


     DTA; and


b)   a written undertaking to inform their CSDP, broker or the Company should the circumstances


     affecting the reduced rate change or the beneficial owner cease to be the beneficial owner,


     both in the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service. Non-


     resident shareholders are advised to contact their CSDP, broker or the Company to arrange for


     the abovementioned documents to be submitted prior to payment of the dividend if such


     documents have not already been submitted, if applicable.


Shareholders are encouraged to consult their professional advisors should they be in any doubt as to the


appropriate action to take.

Prospects


The Group enters the 2026 financial year from a position of strength, supported by a robust operating


performance and the disciplined execution of our strategy. Portfolio fundamentals remain sound, with


consistently low vacancies, improved tenant quality and strong like-for-like net property income growth


across all sectors. The stabilisation of the national electricity grid, easing inflation and a more favourable


interest rate outlook have contributed to a gradual improvement in operating conditions, although


persistent service delivery challenges at municipal level and a fragile macroeconomic backdrop continue


to present risks.


Against this environment, the portfolio remains resilient and well positioned for further growth. Progress


continues on our strategic transition toward a retail-focused portfolio, with non-core disposals and


selective, accretive acquisitions enhancing long-term sustainability and earnings visibility. Based on


current assumptions, distributable earnings per B share for the 2026 financial year are expected to be


between 52.5 cents per share and 53.4 cents per share, an increase of between 9.0% and 11.0% (2025:


48.15 cents per share). Distribution per A share will increase by the lesser of 5% or the most recent


Consumer Price Index, as set out in the Company's Memorandum of Incorporation. The Board has


resolved to maintain the dividend payout ratio at 100% of distributable earnings, subject to its normal


bi-annual review.


This guidance assumes no material deterioration in prevailing macroeconomic and socio-political


conditions, no major corporate or tenant failures, continued tenant affordability in absorbing rising


municipal and utility charges, and no significant disruption from civil unrest. Forecast rental income is


based on contractual escalations and anticipated market-related lease renewals and further assumes that


Dipula maintains its communicated payout ratio and distribution expectations. This forecast is the


responsibility of the Board and has not been reviewed or reported on by the Group's external auditors.
