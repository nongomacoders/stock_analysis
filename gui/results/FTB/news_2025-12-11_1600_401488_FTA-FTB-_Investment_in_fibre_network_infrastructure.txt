INVESTMENT IN FIBRE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE


1. INTRODUCTION


    Fairvest has invested in fibre network infrastructure by subscribing for shares in Onepath


    Investments (RF) Proprietary Limited ("Onepath"), which is a subsidiary of Fairvest.


    Onepath is a digital infrastructure investor focussed on fibre network infrastructure in townships


    across South Africa. The infrastructure is acquired from and leased back to Fibertime Networks


    Proprietary Limited ("fibertimeTM"), a fibre network operator and internet service provider.


    fibertimeTM advances digital inclusion in South African townships by providing high quality


    internet-access to township homes and communities on a pay-as-you-go model. This enables


    affordable, fast and reliable connectivity for households in underserviced areas.


    Neither fibertimeTM nor any of its shareholders are related parties to Fairvest.


2. RATIONALE


    Fairvest's investment in Onepath, provides Fairvest with a stable, accretive dividend yield generated


    from the rentals received on the underlying fibre network infrastructure operated by fibertimeTM.


    The investment further provides Fairvest with access, information and insights that are valuable to


    its existing retail portfolio and to the assessment of new retail opportunities. Digital inclusion in


    underserviced communities unlocks opportunities for education, employment, entrepreneurship and


    entertainment. As these communities are uplifted, Fairvest's core retail market is strengthened in


    both its current and future areas of operation.


3. SALIENT TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT


    To date, Fairvest has subscribed for 4 768 523 Onepath shares for an aggregate subscription


    consideration of R476.9 million. Effective 10 December 2025, Fairvest has committed to invest up


    to R1 billion in aggregate in Onepath (the "Investment").


    Onepath acquires fibre networks at development cost in certain minimum tranches once metrics for


    commercially viability have been met. fibertimeTM pays Onepath a base rental and a turnover rental


    in terms of a 10-year lease, which fibertimeTM may extend for further 10-year periods at a rental


    agreed or determined by an expert.


    As the leases are triple net, fibertimeTM is responsible for the insurance, repair and maintenance and


    support services in respect of the fibre networks it rents.


    At 30 September 2025, Onepath had concluded sale and lease agreements in respect of fibre


    networks that are commercially operational in the following townships:
