GCR REVISES THE OUTLOOK ON NORTHAM'S LONG-TERM ISSUER RATING OF A+ (ZA) TO POSITIVE, ON THE BACK OF AN IMPROVING


OPERATIONAL PROFILE, EXPECTED STRONGER EARNINGS AND FINANCIAL POSITION


GCR Ratings ("GCR") has affirmed Northam Platinum's national scale long-term and short-term issuer ratings at A+(ZA)


and A1(ZA), respectively, with the rating outlook revised to Positive from Stable. Concurrently, GCR has affirmed


Northam Holdings' national scale long-term and short-term issuer ratings at A+(ZA) and A1(ZA), respectively. The rating


outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable.


The affirmation of Northam's rating and the revision of its outlook to Positive reflect the continued operational


development at the group's mines, which together with its sustainable cost advantage, serve to enhance its business


profile.


Northam has reached 1 million platinum group metal ("PGM") ounce 4E sales and is nearing its 1 million ounce


production target from own operations (i.e. excluding purchased metal). With PGM prices having notably improved and


forecast to remain broadly firmer, GCR anticipates upside to its base case and expects earnings to improve significantly,


and gearing metrics to strengthen. Additionally, Northam is expected to maintain a robust liquidity profile.


GCR notes that Northam's competitive position has progressively strengthened through strong project execution,


leading to continued production expansion and the prioritisation of operational improvements. GCR views Northam's


low-cost position as a key benefit to through-the-cycle profitability. Additionally, chrome production has also become a


valuable emerging businesses segment, serving to diversify income streams. Northam has advanced its environmental


strategy including various large-scale renewable projects at different stages of completion, which will strengthen energy


security, lower long-term energy costs, and enable the achievement of decarbonisation targets.


The Positive outlook reflects GCR's view that sustained operational improvements, disciplined capital management,


and the expected earnings recovery will strengthen Northam's credit profile over the next 12 to 18 months.
