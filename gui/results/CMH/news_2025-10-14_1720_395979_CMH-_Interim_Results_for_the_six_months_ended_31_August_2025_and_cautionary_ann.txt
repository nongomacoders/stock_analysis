SHARE REPURCHASE OFFER


The Group currently has, and has had for a number of years, cash resources which are surplus to its present and


reasonably foreseeable requirements. Having reviewed cash flow projections, the directors do not anticipate that the


resources will be required in the next 12 months for operational or other reasons.


Consequently, the directors believe that, rather than earn a relatively low interest return on the surplus funds, optimal use


thereof can better be made by returning the surplus to shareholders by way of a pro rata share repurchase offer ("Share


Repurchase Offer").


Whilst the full details including the pricing and timing of the Share Repurchase Offer are still to be determined, the salient


features of the Share Repurchase Offer are as follows:


- the Share Repurchase Offer will be restricted to a maximum number of 11 220 000 shares, representing 15% of the


  Company's total present issued ordinary shares; and


- shareholders may tender for repurchase as many or few shares as they decide.


DIVIDEND*


In view of the Share Repurchase Offer proposed and detailed above, the directors propose that the value of the traditional


dividend payable in December each year be included in the value of the Share Repurchase Offer, and no separate dividend


will be paid. The directors anticipate that traditional dividend payments will resume from June 2026.


CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT


Accordingly, until such time as the full details of the Share Repurchase Offer are determined, shareholders are advised to


exercise caution when trading in their CMH shares until a full SENS announcement is made.


SHORT-FORM ANNOUNCEMENT


This short-form announcement is the responsibility of the directors. It is only a summary of the information contained


in the full announcement and does not contain complete details. Any investment decision should be based on the


full announcement which can be found on the Company's website at www.cmh.co.za and through the JSE cloudlink


https://senspdf.jse.co.za/documents/2025/jse/isse/CMH/CMHIR2025.pdf. The results for the six months ended


31 August 2025 have not been reviewed nor audited by the Company's auditor.
