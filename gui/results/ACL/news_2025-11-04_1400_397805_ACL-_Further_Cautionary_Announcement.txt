FURTHER CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT


Shareholders are referred to the various cautionary announcements released on the Stock Exchange


News Service of the JSE Limited, the most recent of which was released on 22 September 2025.


Engagements to explore alternative solutions continue. Further announcements will be made in relation to these


matters as and when appropriate.


Accordingly, shareholders are advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in the Company's


securities until a further announcement is made.


UPDATE


The process to place the Longs Business into care and maintenance has proceeded and most plants at Newcastle


Works have been placed into care and maintenance and production has ceased. Limited trading will continue to


despatch the remaining stock.


The National Unions of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) challenged the Section 189 process that was


concluded in March 2025 and the Labour Court found that the Company should conduct further consultations, that


no further dismissals are to take place until this consultation process is completed and that employees should be


reinstated. ArcelorMittal South Africa has applied for leave to appeal the decision.
