UPDATE ON ARCELORMITTAL SOUTH AFRICA'S LONG STEEL BUSINESS ("THE


LONGS BUSINESS")


Shareholders are referred to the various announcements released on the Stock Exchange


News Service of the JSE Limited ("SENS"), the most recent of which was released on


11 August 2025.


In terms of the abovementioned announcements, ArcelorMittal South Africa previously


announced that during the six- month deferral period ending on 30 September 2025 ("Deferral


Period"), "the Company has been exploring various strategic options while the IDC has


simultaneously been conducting its due diligence into the Company and the Government has


been pursuing structural interventions. Significant effort has been given to this exercise, which


remains ongoing".


It was also stated in the SENS announcement released on 14 July 2025 that the Longs


Business " will only be able to continue with financial support as the Company does not have


the ability to bear any further financial risk associated with its continued operations after the


Deferral Period. Therefore, unless a solution is implemented timeously, and to ensure the


orderly closure of the Longs Business as soon as possible after the Deferral Period,


ArcelorMittal South Africa may have no option but to take certain operational steps to prepare


for the wind down process well in advance of 30 September 2025".


Unfortunately, despite the hard work put in by management, the IDC, Government and other


stakeholders, a solution has not been implemented. Further, funding to operate the Longs


Business beyond 30 September 2025 has not been obtained.


In the circumstances, the Newcastle blast furnace has been placed into temporary care and


maintenance and the Company must now take further preparatory steps towards the potential


closure of the Longs Business, including communication with employees. At the appropriate


time, and to the extent required, the relevant notices in terms of the Labour Relations Act may


need to be issued.


Notwithstanding, the Longs Business will continue trading until shortly after the Deferral Period.


The Flats Business, on the other hand, remains operational and available to meet customer


requirements.


The IDC due diligence process has not been concluded and remains ongoing.


Accordingly, shareholders are advised to continue to exercise caution when dealing in the


Company's securities until a further announcement is made.


ArcelorMittal South Africa will provide further updates on this process as may be required.
