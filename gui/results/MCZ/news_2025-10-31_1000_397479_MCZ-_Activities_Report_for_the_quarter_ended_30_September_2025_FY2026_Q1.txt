ACTIVITIES REPORT FOR THE QUARTER ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025 (FY2026 Q1) FOR MC MINING LIMITED (MC Mining


or the Company) AND ITS SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES


HIGHLIGHTS


Operations


?   Health and safety performance across the group improved, with the Company having operated


    with no lost time injuries (LTI) for the quarter. The Makhado steelmaking hard coking coal Project


    (Makhado Project or Makhado) has now reached 911 days LTI-free, for 949,000 manhours


    worked, whilst Uitkomst steelmaking coal Colliery (Uitkomst Colliery or Uitkomst) reached 228


    days LTI-free;


?   Development of the Makhado Project progressed well, with key milestones achieved despite


    experiencing some construction delays: commissioning activities for the coal handling and


    preparation plant (CHPP or Coal Plant) are expected to begin by December 2025; the principal


    mining contractor has commenced with the open pit mining of the box cut; civil foundational


    works for the Coal Plant are largely complete; and significant progress is being made towards the


    commissioning of the 14km overhead power transmission line;


?   The operational improvement plan for Uitkomst Colliery (Turnaround Plan) was approved and key


    improvement initiatives are being executed accordingly. Overhead cost reductions are being


    realised and focus has moved to increasing production via improved equipment availabilities and


    utilisation. Improved production is expected in the last quarter of this calendar year.


?   Run-of-mine (ROM) coal production from Uitkomst Colliery decreased by 21% on the previous


    quarter's production, and was 8% lower than the comparative period in FY2025 at 82,588 tonnes


    (t) (FY2025 Q1: 90,069t). The reduction in production, compared to FY2025 Q1, was due to delays


    in the start of the turnaround plan, temporary operational challenges (geological intrusions) and


    reduced machine availability due to intensive repair and refurbishment being carried as part of


    turnaround plan;


?   Uitkomst Colliery sold 47,116t of high-grade coal during the quarter (FY2025 Q1: 47,586t), a 1%


    decrease on the prior year sales, and there was no sales of the lower grade middlings coal (FY2025


    Q1: 8,719). Coal plant yields remained high at 73% due to operational improvement initiatives


    over the period, which offset the lower ROM coal production;


?   Limited activities were undertaken at the Company's Vele Aluwani semi-soft coking coal (SSCC)


    and thermal coal (TC) Colliery (Vele Colliery or Vele), whilst the numerous coal deposits within


    the Greater Soutpansberg Projects (GSP) were evaluated and prioritised for development; and


?   Depressed TC prices continued with average prices of US$91/t for the three months, compared to


    US$90/t in Q4 FY2025 and US$110/t in Q1 of FY2025. Premium steelmaking HCC prices have


    decreased, averaging US$185/t in the quarter compared to US$212/t in FY2025 Q1.


Corporate


? Available cash and facilities was US$13.2 million at the period end (FY2025 Q4: US$7.4 million);


? Kinetic Development Group Limited (KDG) made payments amounting to US$15 million for the


    purchase of MC Mining shares, as part of the share subscription agreement, during the quarter.


    US$5 million of the payment relates to the fourth Second Closing and US$10 million of the payment


    relates to the fifth Second Closing as per the Share Subscription Agreement;


? The Company made a further repayment of ZAR10 million towards the Industrial Development


   Corporation (IDC) loan during the quarter;


? Permanent appointment of Ms Yi (Christine) He as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer


   of MC Mining Limited.


Events subsequent to the end of the quarter


? Jianheng (Albert) Deng was appointed as a Non-Executive Director of MC Mining; and


? Zhen (Brian) He resigned from being a Non-Executive Director of MC Mining.


DETAILED QUARTERLY OPERATIONS REPORTS


Makhado HCC Project ? Soutpansberg Coalfield, Limpopo Province, South Africa (67% owned)


Project Overview. Construction of the Makhado steelmaking hard coking coal Project (Makhado


Project or Makhado) progressed well, with commissioning activities of the Coal Plant scheduled to


begin in December 2025, despite experiencing some construction delays. During the quarter, more


project development milestones were successfully achieved, whilst maintaining the excellent safety,


health, environmental and regulatory compliance performances that have become a recognizable


feature of the venture to date. The colliery will be South Africa's largest hard coking coal (HCC)


producer, designed to produce 800,000 tonnes a year of HCC 64 Mid Vol, once steady-state operation


for the foundation phase is reached. The life-of-mine (LOM) for the Makhado Colliery is planned to


be 28 years. Contiguous to the Makhado Project are the satellite Greater Soutpansberg Projects (GSP),


that are all at granted Mining Right status, also endowed with steelmaking HCC potential, and


scheduled to be the focus of mine planning, once the Makhado Project is commissioned.


Health, Safety, Regulatory Compliance and Environmental Performance.          The Makhado Project


achieved another quarter free from any LTIs (FY2025 Q4: nil), with 911 days LTI-free and 949,000


manhours now accumulated for the project to date. Employee health initiatives focused on raising


awareness on mental health, men's health and chronic conditions management. The workforce onsite


now numbers 790 people of whom 312 are employed from the host communities. In line with the


project's social and labour plan commitments and environmental management obligations, designs to


improve the regional roads (D745 and D3672) are largely completed, and a host community business


has been contracted to undertake the road maintenance.


The mine continued to be built with zero reportable environmental incidents and keen emphasis being


placed on environmental protection and management. As of the reporting date, the Department of


Mineral and Petroleum Resources (DMPR) undertook a comprehensive and multi-discipline onsite


health and safety, environmental, social and labour planning and regulatory compliance audit of the


Makhado Project. The Pollution Prevention Plan and the Greenhouse Gases Emission report were


approved by the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, further improving the


environmental credentials of the Makhado Project. The Company continues to promote collaborative


and constructive relationships with regulatory authorities and host community stakeholders.


Project Development Milestones Achieved. The Makhado Project is progressing strongly with more


key development milestones achieved this quarter. Coal Plant commissioning activities are expected


to start during December 2025, despite delays encountered due to inclement weather, sourcing of


suitable construction materials and obtaining of all requisite clearances to continue with construction


of the 14km long power transmission line. The project expenditure remains within the budgeted


estimates. Noteworthy features of the project include:


-   Open pit Mining: ? Open pit mining of the boxcut commenced during the quarter, with the


    first in-pit blast being performed in early October 2025. JCI Mining (Pty) Ltd ('JCI'), the principal


    mining contractor, now has 167 people onsite, with a mining fleet consisting of 8 backhoe


    configured excavators, supported by a team of 33 articulated dump trucks. A further 4 trucks


    are schedule to be mobilised during the coming quarter. Mining of overburden material is


    progressing steadily, with 1.3 million bench cubic metres (BCM) already mined. Coal exposure


    is anticipated by November 2025.


-   Construction of the Coal Plant: ? Civil foundational works are largely complete, and the focus


    has now shifted to steelwork, mechanical, and equipment installations. Despite the delays


    experienced due to weather, sourcing of construction materials, obtaining clearances to


    continue with powerline construction and slow deliveries of equipment procured offshore,


    commissioning activities are scheduled to commence in December 2025. Site infrastructure


    development is advancing steadily. Access and bulk services remain on schedule for


    completion in time for production start-up. Mine access roads are complete and currently


    undergoing wear course and stormwater drainage works. The CHPP will process ROM coal to


    produce a primary product of HCC 64 Mid Vol and a secondary product of 5,500kcal API4


    thermal coal (TC). Work is continuing on the planning of the expansion strategy once the


    foundation phase is commissioned. Environmental and Process Technologies (Enprotec), the


    lead contractors for building the Coal Plant, now manage 450 persons on site, across 16


    different sub-contractors, with 140 of these employees having been recruited from the host


    communities.


-   Construction of permanent access bridge: - The construction of a permanent bridge crossing


    the Mutamba River, to provide access to the mine site is continuing. The Matamba River


    bridge is advancing, with foundation works to be completed in October 2025 and overall


    completion expected in December 2025. A temporary access bridge, completed in FY2025 Q3


    is currently being used to provide site access.


-   Construction power reticulation: ?The main power supply line construction is progressing well


    and remains on track for completion in December 2025. This power line, the Paradise


    Overhead Line (OHL), will be a 14km long, 22kV bulk power transmission line, to deliver


    7.5MVA of power to the site from the national grid, via the nearby Paradise Power Station.


    This workstream is being managed by the EHL Engineering Group (EHL) on an EPC-turnkey


    basis.


Outlook. Construction work and operational readiness activities are ongoing, with commissioning


activities for the Coal Plant expected to commence by December 2025.


Uitkomst steelmaking coal Colliery ? Utrecht Coalfields, KwaZulu Natal Province, South Africa (84%


owned)


Colliery Overview. Intensive re-engineering and operational reviews were completed, resulting in the


development of a performance improvement plan for the colliery (the Turnaround Plan). The plan


will be fully implemented during the last quarter of this calendar year. With the coal preparation


plant modifications improving yields to 73%, cost base being permanently reduced, the low-seam


zones largely mined through, and fleet remediation underway, production is expected to improve in


the coming quarter.


Health, Safety and Environmental Performance. Uitkomst Colliery had a quarter free of reportable


environmental incidents and LTIs (FY2025 Q4: nil LTI). The concerted efforts by site personnel,


focusing on behaviour-based safety principles, realignment sessions and operational improvement


reviews, have contributed to an improvement in health and safety performance over the period.


Production Performance. The colliery mined 82,588t of ROM coal during the quarter, which was a


21% decrease on the previous quarter, and 8% lower than the comparative period in FY2025 (FY2025


Q1: 90,069t). The 8% decrease in ROM coal production compared to the same period the previous


year was due, in part, to disruptions in production whilst reconfiguring the underground mining layout


as part of the Turnaround Plan and due to lower coal seam mining heights than what was expected in


some sections. Outlook is for an improvement in coal seam mining heights over the next quarter as


the operating sections continue to move through the low seam zones. Underground mining fleet


condition assessments and remediation plans have commenced to be implemented on-going.


Uitkomst sold 47,116t (FY2025 Q1: 47,586t) of high-grade duff and peas coal, which is in-line with the


sales for same period last year. The colliery sold no middlings coal during the three months (FY2025


Q1: 8,719t). The colliery had 3,088t (FY2025 Q1: 2,343) of high-grade coal inventory at the end of


September 2025.


The production costs per saleable tonne were 9% higher than the comparative period in FY2025


(FY2026 Q1: US$107/t vs. FY2025 Q1: US$97/t). The decrease in volumes resulted in the increase in


unit production costs. This was partially offset by the improved yields.


Outlook. Uitkomst Colliery, as of the end of the quarter, has commenced with the implementation of


the Turnaround Plan.      The focus remains on implementing initiatives to improve equipment


availability whilst maintaining excellent safety performance.        The Turnaround Plan is being


implemented with the assistance of Metalla Tutum Engineering Proprietary Limited (MTE). MTE is a


South African specialist mining engineering and consulting firm, established in 2017, with expertise in


mine management and operational improvements.
