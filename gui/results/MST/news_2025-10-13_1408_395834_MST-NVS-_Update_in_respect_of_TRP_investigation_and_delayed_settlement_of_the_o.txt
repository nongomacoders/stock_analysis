 UPDATE ANNOUNCEMENT IN RESPECT OF TRP INVESTIGATION AND DELAYED SETTLEMENT OF


 THE OFFER BY NOVUS TO MUSTEK SHAREHOLDERS


 NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, DIRECTLY OR


 INDIRECTLY, IN, INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A


 VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OR REGULATIONS OF SUCH JURISDICTION


1.      INTRODUCTION


        1.1.    Shareholders of Mustek ("Mustek Shareholders") are referred to:


                1.1.1.       the firm intention announcement released by Novus on SENS on 15 November


                             2024 and the subsequent announcements regarding the mandatory offer by


                             Novus to Mustek Shareholders (the "Mandatory Offer");


                1.1.2.       the combined offer circular outlining details of the Mandatory Offer ("Circular"),


                             which was distributed on Friday, 30 May 2025 as well as the SENS


                             announcement of 30 May 2025 alerting Mustek Shareholders of the Circular (the


                             "30 May Announcement"). Copies of the Circular are available on Novus'


                             website at https://novus.holdings/investor-centre/ and Mustek's website at


                             https://mustek.co.za/investor/; and


                1.1.3.       the joint SENS announcement released on 1 August 2025 (the "Prior


                             Announcement") which, inter alia, advised of an investigation initiated by the


                             TRP into matters described therein (the "TRP Investigation").


        1.2.    Unless otherwise specified, capitalised terms utilised herein shall bear the meaning ascribed


                thereto in the "Interpretation and Definitions" section of the Circular.


2.      UPDATE ON THE TRP INVESTIGATION


        2.1.    Novus and Mustek hereby advise that, as at the date of this announcement, the TRP


                Investigation remains ongoing and Mustek Shareholders will be duly advised once there are


                any material developments in this respect.


        2.2.    As noted in the Prior Announcement, the TRP cannot issue a certificate of compliance whilst


                the TRP Investigation is ongoing and accordingly, in the absence of obtaining a certificate of


                compliance from the TRP, pursuant to the provisions of Regulation 102(13)(b) of the Takeover


                Regulations, Novus, as the offeror, cannot proceed to implement or give effect to (i) the


                Mandatory Offer; and/or (ii) the Comparable Offer, until such time as the TRP has issued a


                compliance certificate. Accordingly, Novus cannot commence settling the Offer Consideration


                and/or the Comparable Offer Consideration.


3.   IMPLICATIONS FOR MUSTEK SHAREHOLDERS AND SAR PARTICIPANTS


     Accordingly,


     3.1.    Mustek Shareholders who have accepted, or intend to accept, the Mandatory Offer; and


     3.2.    SAR Participants who have accepted, or intend to accept, the Comparable Offer,


     should note that settlement of the Offer Consideration will only occur after the TRP has issued the


     required compliance certificate. As mentioned in the 30 May Announcement, a further announcement


     will be made as soon as the compliance certificate has been obtained from the TRP, whereafter Novus


     will proceed to settle the Offer Consideration and the Comparable Offer, as the case may be, on the


     basis set out in the Circular, subject to an updated timetable to be announced at that time.

     Novus, to the extent that the information relates directly to Novus:


     4.1.    accepts responsibility for the information contained in this announcement;
