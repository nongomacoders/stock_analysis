MERGER OF THE SOUTHERN CAPE FORESTRY AND SAWMILLING BUSINESSES OF PG BISON


SOUTHERN CAPE (PTY) LTD AND MTO FORESTRY (PTY) LTD (CATEGORY 2 DISPOSAL


ANNOUNCEMENT)


1.     INTRODUCTION


       Shareholders are advised that on 29 October 2025 ("Signature Date"), PG Bison (Pty) Ltd ("PGB"), a wholly


       owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a sale of shares and claims agreement ("Disposal


       Agreement") as part of a suite of inter-related agreements ("Transaction Agreements"), the implementation


       of which will effectively result in PGB merging its non-core forestry, sawmilling and pole operations in the


       Southern Cape, conducted by its wholly owned subsidiary PG Bison Southern Cape (Pty) Ltd ("PGBSC"),


       with the Southern and Eastern Cape forestry and sawmilling operations ("MTO Cape Business") of MTO


       Forestry (Pty) Ltd ("MTO Forestry") (hereinafter referred to as "the Transaction").


2.     RATIONALE FOR THE TRANSACTION AND PGBSC DISPOSAL


2.1.      The Southern and Eastern Cape regions have experienced devastating fires in recent years which have


          severely impacted the forestry and sawmilling sector in the region. The sector is therefore operating sub-


          optimally and, based on the extended growing cycle of forestry assets, it will take several years for


          operations to recover to pre-fire levels. As a consequence, the parties to the Transaction (listed in 3 below)


          have reduced investment into their respective business operations within the sector. Accordingly, the


          performance of the PGBSC operations have been adversely impacted and will continue to constrain


          PGBSC's earnings and returns for the foreseeable future.


2.2.      The Transaction which combines the MTO Cape Business and the business operations of PGBSC will


          establish a significant black controlled entity in the forestry and sawmilling industry with increased


          production and reliability of sawlog supply, improved efficiencies and reduced costs, all of which should


          encourage further investment and enhance competitiveness.


3.     PARTIES TO THE TRANSACTION


       The following entities will be party to the Transaction:


3.1.      PGBSC, a wholly owned subsidiary of PGB and the Company;


3.2.      MTO Forestry, the issued shares of which are currently owned by the following entities:


3.2.1.       ASF Holdings Cayman Ltd, a limited liability private company duly incorporated in the Cayman Islands,


             the beneficial owners of which are not related parties of the Company;


3.2.2.       Wild Peach Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd ("WPI"), the beneficial owners of which comprise various


             individuals and family trusts, none of which are related parties to the Company;


3.2.3.       South African Forestry Company SOC Ltd ("Safcol"), a state owned company which holds its MTO


             Forestry shares on behalf of communities. These shares will be transferred to MTO Community SPV


             (RF) (Pty) Ltd ("MTO Community SPV"), a ring-fenced company incorporated to hold shares in CFP


             (as defined below), and the shares in MTO Community SPV will be held by a community trust to be


             registered by Safcol; and


3.3.      Cape Forests Products (Pty) Ltd ("CFP"), a newly incorporated company, specifically established by the


          parties for purposes of the Transaction.


4.     PARTICULARS OF THE TRANSACTION AND PGBSC DISPOSAL


4.1.      In terms of the Transaction, the parties will establish a more resilient and competitive, black controlled


          forestry and sawmilling group within the Southern and Eastern Cape, by merging the below business


          operations into the newly established CFP:

          after, inter alia, completion of the Excluded Assets Sale (discussed in 4.1.2 above). Following the Excluded


          Assets Sale:

5.     FINANCIAL INFORMATION


5.1.      The Parties have agreed the valuations of the PGBSC Equity and the MTO Forestry Equity (post the

          above, it is anticipated that, following the Transaction, the derecognition by PGB of an investment in a


          subsidiary, PGBSC, and the recognition by PGB of an investment in an associate, CFP, will not have a


          material negative impact on the Company's profit and loss in terms of IFRS.
