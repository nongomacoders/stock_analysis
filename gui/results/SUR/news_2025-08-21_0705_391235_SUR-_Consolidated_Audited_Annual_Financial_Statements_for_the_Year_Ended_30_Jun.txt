TRADING PERFORMANCE


The South Africa Restaurant Market Report^ indicates that the South African Reserve Bank's


interest rate cuts have bolstered consumer spending, providing a favourable climate for


restaurants. Despite reductions in borrowing costs and food inflation, disposable income and


discretionary spend have however not yet seen significant increases. The competitive


landscape continues to evolve with a broader range of players vying for market share. Beyond


traditional competitors, the group now faces challenges from supermarket retailers' product


offerings.


Despite market conditions, our franchisees and operational teams have remained resilient.


The group achieved a solid trading performance with franchised restaurant sales increasing


by 8.3% over the prior year.


The group continues to offer a high standard of family dining experiences, supported by


dominant value-added campaigns and AI driven data analytics for targeted marketing to its


customer loyalty clubs.


Our franchisees have demonstrated their commitment by investing in our refreshed brand


identities. The transformation of the Spur brand has ignited heightened interest among


consumers and franchisees, resulting in 51 outlets now trading under the new concept and


delivering a revitalised dining experience. Panarottis' repositioning continues to gain traction,


buoyed by positive customer feedback. Currently, 55% of the Panarottis network displays the


updated store design. John Dory's has also embraced this approach, with three restaurants


now operating in their refreshed format and five more undergoing transformation. The group's


brand evolution strategy extends to its speciality dining segment. Enhanced designs have


already been considered and are being implemented for Hussar Grill and Doppio Zero.


Although annual customer count numbers remain unchanged from the previous year,


pleasingly average-spend-per-head grew above menu-price inflation. The group successfully


trades in all day parts: breakfast, lunch (the largest revenue stream) and dinner.


The group traded through 724 restaurants in 14 countries at the end of June 2025 (2024: 701).


In South Africa, 31 restaurants were opened during the year and 15 restaurants were closed.


Internationally, the group opened 15 new restaurants and eight restaurants were closed.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE


The trading performance led to continued strong growth in both group revenue and profit.


Group revenue increased by 11.2% to R3 863.2 million (2024: R3 473.6 million).The revenue


growth was supported by higher sales in the retail company stores, which rose by 46.3%,


positively impacted by the contribution from the Doppio Collection restaurants, as well as a


10.1% increase in sales from the manufacturing and distribution division. Improved franchised


restaurant turnovers of 8.3% over the prior year further boosted the revenue growth.


Group profit before income tax increased by 17.5% to R401.7 million (2024: R341.7 million).


Group headline earnings increased by 16.5% to R275.0 million (2024: R236.1 million), with


diluted headline earnings per share 16.4% higher at 331.02 cents (2024: 284.34 cents).


The company's unrestricted cash balance was R477.1 million (2024: R365.7 million).


The cash generation and the allocation of the group's capital remain key focus areas of the


executive directors and the board of directors of the company ("board").


PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDEND


The group has historically distributed a substantial portion of headline earnings as dividends.


The board evaluates capital allocation priorities, weighing dividend distributions against other


opportunities such as share repurchases and strategic investments. Key considerations


include market conditions, trading outlook, forecasted cash generation, contingent liabilities,


and overall liquidity. This approach enables the board to respond to evolving market dynamics


and allocate capital effectively.


Shareholders are advised that the board has, on 20 August 2025, resolved to declare a final


gross cash dividend for the year ended 30 June 2025 of R175.6 million, which equates to


193.0 cents per share and the full-year dividend increasing by 40.4% to 299.0 cents per share,


for each of the 90 996 932 shares in issue, subject to the applicable tax levied in terms of the


Income Tax Act (Act No. 58 of 1962), as amended (dividend withholding tax).


The dividend has been declared from income reserves. The dividend withholding tax is 20%


and a net dividend of 154.4 cents per share will be paid to those shareholders who are not


exempt from dividend withholding tax.


The company's income tax reference number is 9695015033. The company has 90 996 932


shares in issue at the date of declaration.


In accordance with the provisions of Strate, the electronic settlement and custody system used


by the JSE Limited, the relevant dates for the dividend are as follows:


 Event                                           Date


 Last day to trade "cum dividend"                Tuesday, 9 September 2025

September 2025, and Friday, 12 September 2025, both days inclusive.


OUTLOOK


With a diverse portfolio of 10 restaurant brands, the group is poised to capture market share


across various categories, regions and countries. The group focuses on providing growing


middle-income markets with casual dining restaurant experiences through our family sit-down


and fast-casual restaurants, while offering specialty dining experiences to higher-income


customers.


While trading conditions will remain challenging in the short to medium term owing to pressure


on consumer spending in the weak macro-economic climate, the group is positive on the


company's longer-term prospects. The outlook will be focused on creating better, more, and


new value for our customers, franchisees, employees and investors.


The group continues to secure key trading sites and plans to open 42 new restaurants in South


Africa and 14 internationally for the 2026 financial year.
