MARKET UPDATE


ARBITRATION OUTCOME - LEGAL DISPUTE WITH GPS FOOD GROUP


Background


As previously reported, two companies within the group ("the Defendants") were served with a


summons in 2019 by GPS Food Group RSA (Pty) Ltd ("GPS").


GPS alleges that


   -   an oral agreement was concluded between GPS and the two defendants in terms of which


       the parties would, inter alia, establish a joint venture to acquire, develop and manage a rib


       processing facility, with a damages claim ranging between R119.9 million and R167.0


       million (Claim A);


   -   with an alternative delictual claim of approximately R95.8 million, comprising GPS's alleged


       accumulated losses to the date of the claim (Claim B).


The parties agreed to refer the matter to arbitration, which commenced on 23 October 2023.


Closing arguments were heard on 9 December 2024.


Arbitration outcome ? part award


Shareholders are advised that the Arbitrator made a part award yesterday, 26 August 2025, where


he found in favour of GPS against one of the group entities on the merits of Claim A, but has not


yet determined or made any award on the quantum of damages. No award has been made on


Claim B.


The group intends to lodge an appeal against this award, in terms of its rights in the arbitration


agreement, within the next 30 days.


An appeal would constitute an appeal panel of three arbitrators. The pleadings and documents


that served before the Arbitrator in the arbitration will serve before the appeal panel. An appeal


award would ultimately be final and binding and there is no further right of appeal. The appeal


process timeline is currently uncertain.


The group will continue to update shareholders with any meaningful developments in this matter.


The company's liquidity position and dividend declarations remain unaffected by this part award.
