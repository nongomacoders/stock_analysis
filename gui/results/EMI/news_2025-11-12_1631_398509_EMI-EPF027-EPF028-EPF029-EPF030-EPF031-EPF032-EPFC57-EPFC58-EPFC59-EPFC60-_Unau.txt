ISIN: ZAE000203063

UNAUDITED SUMMARISED INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30


SEPTEMBER 2025 AND DIVIDEND DECLARATION


NATURE OF BUSINESS


Emira is a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT") domiciled in South Africa and, together with all its


subsidiaries, owns a portfolio of property investments which are sectorally and geographically


diversified. Through this risk-mitigating diversification strategy Emira continues to deliver returns


throughout the cycles.


The Fund has direct property holdings as well as indirect property investments, through equity


investments in property owning companies with specialist third-party co-investors.


In South Africa, the Fund owns a direct portfolio of properties diversified across the retail, industrial,


office and residential sectors, which it segregates between the Commercial Portfolio (the retail,


industrial and office properties) and the Residential Portfolio (the residential properties) respectively.


During the reporting period the Fund acquired a 6,4% equity interest in SA Corporate Real Estate


Limited, a diversified, JSE-listed real estate investment trust with a well-balanced and defensive


property portfolio focused primarily on the retail, industrial, and residential sectors. The investment


is consistent with Emira's strategy of acquiring interests in undervalued, quality assets.


Emira has international exposure through its indirect property investments in the United States of


America (the "USA" or "US") and Poland. In the USA, Emira has equity interests in 10 grocery-anchored


dominant value-oriented power centres, held together with its US-based partner, The Rainier


Companies. In Poland, Emira has a 45% equity interest in DL Invest Group S.A., a Luxembourg-


headquartered property company which develops and holds industrial and logistics centres, mixed-


use/office centres, and retail parks across Poland.


COMMENTARY


These results are for the six months ended 30 September 2025 (the "current reporting period" or "the


current period") and are compared to the six months ended 30 September 2024 ("prior period" or the


"comparative period").


Distributable earnings for the current reporting period is R324,5m compared to R332,5m for the


prior period. The number of Emira shares in issue reduced to 500,862,855 following the cancellation


of 14,604,392 shares acquired through the Fund's share repurchase programme. Emira has applied


for the delisting and cancellation of a further 315,254 shares, acquired during the current reporting


period, which will reduce the number of shares in issue to 500,547,601. After taking the adjustments


to reflect the cash backed position into account, Emira's Board of Directors (the "Board") has


declared an interim dividend of 64,40 cents per share for the current reporting period (September


2024: 62,39 cents). This amounts to a period-on-period increase of 3,2%.

Record date                                             Friday, 5 December 2025


Payment date                                            Monday, 8 December 2025


Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 3 December

In accordance with Emira's status as a REIT, shareholders are advised that the dividend meets


the requirements of a "qualifying distribution" for the purposes of section 25BB of the Income


Tax Act, No. 58 of 1962 ("Income Tax Act"). Accordingly, qualifying distributions received by local


tax residents must be included in the gross income of such shareholders (as a non-exempt dividend


in terms of section 10(1)(k)(aa) of the Income Tax Act), with the effect that the qualifying distribution


is taxable as income in the hands of the shareholder. These qualifying distributions are, however,


exempt from dividend withholding tax in the hands of South African tax resident shareholders,


provided that the South African resident shareholders have provided the following forms to their


Central Securities Depository Participant ("CSDP") or broker, as the case may be in respect of


uncertificated shares, or the transfer secretaries, in respect of certificated shares:


a) a declaration that the dividend is exempt from dividends tax; and


b) a written undertaking to inform the CSDP, broker or the transfer secretaries, as the case may be


     should the circumstances affecting the exemption change or the beneficial owner cease to be


     the beneficial owner,


both in the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service.


Shareholders are advised to contact their CSDP, broker or the transfer secretaries, as the case may


be to arrange for the abovementioned documents to be submitted prior to payment of the dividend,


if such documents have not already been submitted.


Qualifying dividends received by non-resident shareholders will not be taxable as income and instead


will be treated as ordinary dividends, but which are exempt in terms of the usual dividend exemptions


per section 10(1)(k) of the Income Tax Act. Any distribution received by a non-resident from a REIT


will be subject to dividend withholding tax at 20% unless the rate is reduced in terms of any applicable


agreement for the avoidance of double taxation ("DTA") between South Africa and the country of


residence of the shareholder. Assuming dividend withholding tax will be withheld at a rate of 20%, the


net amount due to non-resident shareholders will be 51,52000 cents per share. A reduced dividend


withholding tax rate in terms of the applicable DTA, may only be relied on if the non-resident


shareholder has provided the following forms to their CSDP or broker, as the case may be, in respect


of the uncertificated shares, or the transfer secretaries, in respect of certificated shares:


a) a declaration that the dividend is subject to a reduced rate because of the application of a DTA;


   and


b) a written undertaking to inform their CSDP, broker or the transfer secretaries, as the case may


   be should the circumstances affecting the reduced rate change or the beneficial owner cease to


   be the beneficial owner, both in the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African


   Revenue Service. Non-resident shareholders are advised to contact their CSDP, broker or the


   transfer secretaries, as the case may be to arrange for the abovementioned documents to be


   submitted prior to payment of the dividend if such documents have not already been submitted,


   if applicable.


Local tax resident shareholders as well as non-resident shareholders are encouraged to consult their


professional advisors should they be in any doubt as to the appropriate action to take.


The Company's tax reference number is 9995/739/15/9.
