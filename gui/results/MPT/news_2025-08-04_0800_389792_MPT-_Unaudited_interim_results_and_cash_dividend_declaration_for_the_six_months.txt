COMMENTARY FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS


Overview


The Group continued to face a persistently challenging trading environment for the six months ended


30 June 2025, resulting in trading and profitability ending below expectations. The general economy


remained subdued, despite lower interest rates and inflation, while uncertainty across local and global


markets negatively impacted business confidence.


Despite the economic downturn, good volume growth was realised in containerboard, Plastics FMCG


Atlantis and Pinetown, citrus cartons, jumbo bins and agricultural crates. These gains were, however,


offset by declines in cartonboard, corrugated, Plastics FMCG Wadeville and beverage crates.


Bruce Strong, Mpact Chief Executive Officer, said: "We continue to make good progress on our strategic


capital projects, which focus on growth sectors and investments in innovative, higher-margin, and


sustainable products. We remain confident in our value-enhancing strategy and prospects, notwithstanding


the recent headwinds. Our solar PV generated power amounting to 16 MWp, resulted in a saving of over


R20 million in electricity costs during the first half of the year.


The R1.3 billion upgrade project at the Mkhondo mill has reached a significant milestone, with construction


and commissioning of the sodium lignosulphonate (SLS) plant complete, and the pulp mill upgrade in its


final stage of construction. We are encouraged by the progress and remain on track to complete the pulp


mill commissioning during the third quarter of this year. Thereafter, we will require several months to optimise


both plants to reach design specifications and conduct SLS customer trials. This marks a major step


forward in enhancing our operational capabilities and product portfolio to support future growth."


The global cyclical downturn in the paper industry led to lower margins in our Paper business, as selling


prices decreased more than input costs, particularly due to higher local recovered paper prices. We


anticipate that this will remain the case for the remainder of the year. Despite this challenging environment,


we were able to grow local and export containerboard volumes due to the competitive position of our


Felixton paper mill, albeit at lower margins.


Demand from the fruit sector was up on the first half of last year ("prior period"), with good growth in


plastic crates and citrus cartons partially offset by lower sales volumes in banana and avocado cartons.


We anticipate continued growth in the agricultural sector in the second half of 2025. The industrial market


remained weak, impacting our Springs mill, the Paper Converting business and beverage crates. As


anticipated, FMCG Wadeville's volume declined significantly following the expiry of two supply contracts


with a major customer in June 2024.


Mpact Operations (Pty) Ltd, the Group's main trading entity in South Africa, retained its Level 1 B-BBEE


status.


Financial review


Group revenue from continuing operations for the period ended 30 June 2025 increased by 3.2% compared


to the prior period to R6.370 billion (June 2024: R6.173 billion), primarily driven by increased containerboard


sales volumes in the Paper business.


Revenue growth achieved in the Paper business was offset by higher variable costs, particularly increased


recovered paper prices and energy costs, as well as lower sales volumes in the Plastics business, leading


to a 2.8% reduction in the Group's gross profit.


Underlying earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) decreased by 14.5% to


R625 million (June 2024: R731 million) and operating profit by 25.5% to R315 million (June 2024:


R423 million). Fixed costs were well managed, increasing by 1.9% on the prior period.


Return on capital employed (ROCE) for continuing operations was 9.3% (June 2024: 13.5%), reflecting the


impact of substantial capital investments in strategic growth projects which are still underway, as well as


lower profitability. Excluding capital work-in-progress, ROCE for the period was 10.9% (June 2024: 15.5%).


Paper Business


Revenue for the Paper business increased by 6.9% to R5.4 billion (June 2024: R5.1 billion), due to a 5.9%


increase in sales volumes and a 1.0% increase in the average selling price. Volumes increased due to


improved containerboard sales, somewhat offset by lower cartonboard and corrugated sales volumes.


Gross profit was in line with the prior period, with the benefits of increased sales and production volumes


offset by higher recovered paper prices, energy costs and variable selling expenses associated with a


higher proportion of containerboard exports. The gross profit margin declined by 2.7 percentage points.


Underlying operating profit declined to R346 million (June 2024: R414 million) due to a 3.7% increase in


fixed costs related primarily to extensive commercial downtime in the prior period.


The Recycling business successfully increased collection volumes during the period to ensure a consistent


supply to our paper mills and external customers. Recovered paper prices were up significantly compared


to the prior period due to continued export demand, especially from India.


Paper Manufacturing increased containerboard sales volumes by 20.3% following the successful


interventions at the end of 2024 to increase exports and displace imports in the local market, utilising the


improved competitiveness of the Felixton mill following the recent upgrade. This approach mitigated the


impact of cheap recycled containerboard imports, and no commercial downtime was incurred at Felixton


or Mkhondo during the current period. Performance at the Mkhondo mill was impacted by construction


related to the upgrade project.


Cartonboard sales volumes from the Springs paper mill declined by 9.5% due to subdued local market


conditions and import competition. Springs mill took 15 days of commercial downtime in the current


period to manage stock levels. In addition, the mill incurred 18 days of downtime due to external utility


supply interruptions.


Paper Converting's revenue was down 1.3% compared to the prior period, with lower sales volumes


partially offset by an increase in the average selling price. Corrugated sales to the fruit sector were flat and


industrial sales were lower due to weak demand.


Plastics business


Revenue in the Plastics business decreased by 14.7% to R936 million (June 2024: R1,097 million) primarily


due to lower sales volumes at FMCG Wadeville, as anticipated, as well as lower beverage crate sales in


Bins & Crates. This was partially offset by a favourable product mix resulting from the exit of the


abovementioned contracts, as well as good revenue growth in the rest of the FMCG business.


Underlying operating profit was R7 million (June 2024: R64 million) due to a 13.9% reduction in gross profit


arising from lower sales volumes. Controllable costs were well managed. The gross profit margin was


similar to the prior period, and fixed costs decreased by 4.5%. Notwithstanding the decline in profitability


in the first half of the year, we expect an improved full-year result from the Plastics business compared to


the prior year. Historically, profitability in the Plastics business, particularly Bins & Crates, was heavily


weighted towards the second half of the year, and we expect 2025 to be similar.


Bins & Crates experienced good growth in jumbo bins and agricultural crates, which was more than offset


by lower beverage crate sales.


Although the decline in sales volumes at FMCG Wadeville was expected, the new business secured to


offset some of the volume losses did not meet expectations due to the slower-than-expected rollout of new


customer projects. Additionally, several existing customers were affected by a vinegar shortage, which


disrupted mayonnaise production. Despite these challenges, we still anticipate a much-improved second


half in the FMCG Wadeville business.


The rest of the FMCG business increased sales volumes and operating profits in the current period, driven


in part by robust demand in our customers' personal care export markets. Both operations benefit from a


good customer base, and the outlook remains positive.


Net finance costs


Net finance costs decreased to R119 million (June 2024: R148 million) mainly due to lower interest rates


and R36 million (June 2024: R19 million) of interest costs capitalised to the Mkhondo mill project.


Taxation


The effective tax rate for continuing operations of 26.8% is in line with the statutory rate. The prior period


tax charge for continuing operations was restated to disclose the discontinued operation on an after-tax


basis. The restatement did not affect the overall tax charge for total operations in the prior period, which


remained unchanged.


Earnings per share


Headline earnings per share and basic earnings per share decreased to 93.0 cents (June 2024 - restated:


128.1 cents) and 94.2 cents (June 2024 - restated: 129.8 cents), respectively.


Net debt


Net debt of R2.985 billion was lower than the prior period (June 2024: R3.230 billion), but increased from


the 2024 financial year end (December 2024: R2.371 billion), with cash generated from operations being


offset by working capital outflows, typical for the first half of the year, and capital investments, in line with


the Group's strategy.


SUBSEQUENT EVENTS


On 1 August 2025, Mpact increased its shareholding in Seyfert Corrugated Western Cape (Pty) Ltd from


49% to 74% for a cash consideration of R42.6 million.


OUTLOOK


A significant uplift in the South African economy seems unlikely in the near term. Coupled with a challenging


global backdrop, we expect trading conditions to remain difficult in the second half of the year, with a


corresponding impact on profitability. Despite these challenges, we will continue to focus on realising


benefits from our portfolio optimisation and other strategic projects.


Based on current projections, no commercial downtime is anticipated at the containerboard mills. However,


continued pressure on selling prices is expected to offset the positive operating leverage benefits. We also


anticipate cartonboard prices and sales volumes to remain under pressure due to weak local demand and


competitive imports. Unplanned utility disruptions continue to be an issue, particularly at the Springs paper


mill and some other Ekurhuleni-based operations.


The Mkhondo mill upgrade project is on track for the construction and commissioning of the pulp mill to be


completed during the third quarter, following approximately four weeks of downtime.


Thereafter, we will require several months to optimise both the new SLS plant and upgraded pulp mill to


reach design specifications and conduct SLS customer trials. This marks a significant step forward in


enhancing our operational capabilities and product portfolio to support future growth. The contribution


from this project to the Group's overall profitability will be limited for the 2025 financial year.


We continue to see good growth from the agricultural sector in Paper Converting and Bins & Crates, which


has been a strategic focus area for the Group. According to the Citrus Growers Association's latest


estimates, citrus exports for 2025 are expected to exceed those of the prior year, and long-term structural


growth is still anticipated from this sector.


We expect an improved full-year result from the Plastics business compared to the prior year. Both FMCG


Wadeville and Bins & Crates have restructured their cost base, which, along with higher sales volumes,


should improve margins.


We remain confident in our value-enhancing strategy and committed to executing it effectively. Mpact's


strategy focuses on growth sectors and investments in innovative, higher-margin, and sustainable products.


These sectors include fruit exports, returnable transit packaging, convenience shopping and recycling,


some of which are somewhat insulated from the South African consumer spending patterns.


Our strategy aims to consistently yield tangible benefits for the business and improved returns for our


shareholders.
