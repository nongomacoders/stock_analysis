Overview


Clicks Group once again demonstrated the resilience of its core product


offering in a constrained trading environment, delivering growth across


its strategic pillars of value, convenience, differentiation and


personalisation. The group increased diluted headline earnings per share


by 14.1% to 1 362 cents and achieved an industry-leading return on equity


of 49.2%.


Clicks reported strong growth of 10.7% in private label and exclusive


brands which accounted for R9.7 billion of the chain's turnover. Clicks


increased its store base to over 990 following the opening of a net 55


stores and the national pharmacy network was expanded to 780 with the


opening of a net 60 pharmacies during the year.


Clicks ClubCard, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, grew


active membership to 12.6 million and contributed 82.6% of sales in


Clicks. Loyalty members received R855 million in cashback in the past


year, bringing total rewards paid to customers over the past three


decades to R7.5 billion.


The group maintained its track record of shareholder wealth creation. The


total dividend was increased by 14.2% to 886 cents per share, based on a


65% payout ratio. The group returned R2.7 billion to shareholders in


dividend payments of R1.9 billion and share buybacks of R751 million.


Over the past decade, the group has delivered a compound annual growth


rate of 17.3% in total shareholder return.


Financial performance


Group turnover increased by 5.3% to R47.8 billion. Retail turnover, which


includes Clicks, UniCare, The Body Shop and Sorbet corporate stores,


increased by 6.0%.


Comparable store turnover grew by 4.7% (excluding the additional trading


day in the prior period) with inflation of 2.6% and volume growth of


2.1%.


Retail turnover increased by 7.0%, excluding Unicorn Pharmaceuticals


(Unicorn), which was disposed of in the previous financial year.


Distribution turnover grew by 5.1% through increased purchasing


compliance across UPD's core wholesale channels.


Total income grew by 8.4% to R14.9 billion. The retail margin expanded by


70 basis points due to strong growth in higher-margin private label


products and supply chain efficiencies. The distribution margin declined


by 10 basis points, impacted by the lower adjustment in the single exit


price of medicines relative to the prior year. The group's total income


margin expanded by 90 basis points to 31.1% as a result of the stronger


growth in Retail relative to Distribution.


Retail costs grew by 7.9% mainly due to higher wage increases and


increased pharmacy openings as well as higher utility and card acquiring


costs. Comparable retail costs grew by 5.0%. Distribution costs were very


well managed, with expense growth contained to 1.9%.


Group trading profit increased by 12.1% to R4.7 billion and the group's


trading margin increased by 60 basis points to 9.8%. The retail margin


increased from 10.2% to 10.5% and including the intragroup profit from


Unicorn, the margin expanded to 10.8%. UPD increased its trading margin


by 10 basis points to 3.3%.


Headline earnings grew by 13.7% to R3.2 billion. Basic earnings per share


increased by 14.5% to 1 363 cents and headline earnings per share


increased by 14.1% to 1 362 cents.


Inventory levels increased by 10.7% and group inventory days were four


days higher at 78 days. Retail inventory was impacted by a focus on


product availability to drive sales growth as well as new stores opened


in the last two months of the year. UPD inventory was higher due to


demand-driven buy-ins of GLP-1 product and increased Unicorn stock


levels. The group's net working capital days improved from 35 to 34 days.


Cash generated by operations totalled R6.6 billion. Capital expenditure


of R985 million (2024: R891 million) was invested mainly in new stores


and pharmacies, store refurbishments, supply chain and information


technology (IT).


At financial year-end, the group held cash resources of R3.3 billion,


with the final dividend totalling R1.5 billion to be paid to shareholders


in January 2026.


Outlook


While the improvement in South Africa's macroeconomic indicators is


encouraging for retail spending over the medium term, consumer sentiment


and discretionary spending remain under pressure. The group is, however,


well positioned in this environment due to its competitive advantage in


the defensive health and beauty sectors where it holds market-leading


shares in its core retail categories as well as in pharmaceutical


wholesale and distribution.


In the new financial year, management aims to leverage the recent


investments in Sorbet, UniCare and the LEAP pharmacy system while


continuing to invest in enhancing the group's omni-channel capability.


Clicks plans to open 40 ? 50 stores and 40 ? 50 pharmacies in the 2026


financial year and is committed to achieving its medium-term target of


1 200 stores. In addition, the group plans to open 10 ? 15 UniCare


specialised pharmacies over the medium term.


Private label remains the primary driver of the group's differentiation


strategy. The group aims to sustain the strong recent growth momentum in


private label and exclusive brands, targeting a 35% contribution to front


shop sales in the medium term.


Capital expenditure of R1 256 million is planned for the 2026 financial


year. This includes R662 million for new stores and pharmacies and the


refurbishment of 70 ? 80 stores. A further R594 million will be invested


in supply chain, IT and infrastructure.


Final dividend


The board of directors has approved a final gross ordinary dividend for


the period ended 31 August 2025 of 648.0 cents per share (2024: 566.0


cents per share). The source of the dividend will be from distributable


reserves and paid in cash.


Dividends Tax (DT) of 20% amounting to 129.6 cents per ordinary share


will be withheld in terms of the Income Tax Act. Ordinary shareholders


who are not exempt from DT will therefore receive a dividend of 518.4


cents net of DT.


The company has 234 898 662 ordinary shares. Its income tax reference


number is 9061/745/71/8.
