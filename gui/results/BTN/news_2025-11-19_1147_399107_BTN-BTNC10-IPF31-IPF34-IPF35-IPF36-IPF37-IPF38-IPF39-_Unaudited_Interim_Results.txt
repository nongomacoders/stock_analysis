UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS, CASH DIVIDEND AND NOTIFICATION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE


FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025


The board of directors of Burstone ("the Board") is pleased to announce the results for the six months ended 30 September 2025.


OVERVIEW FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025


1H26 Distributable income per share ("DIPS") increased by 3.0% to 51.07 cents (1H25: 49.53 cents), supported by:


-   Strong underlying real estate performance;


-   Growing fee income from the funds and asset management business; and


-   A reduction in total operating overheads of 5.5%


Overall DIPS performance was partially offset by:


-   Marginally dilutive South African asset sales in FY25; and


-   The impact of funding capital expenditure, deployment into Australian investments, deferred consideration and transactional cash


    flow timing


Real estate investment


South Africa:


-   Strong LFL Base NOI growth of 5.3%


-   Improved vacancy of 4.7% (FY25: 6.7%)


-   Improved negative reversions of 2.5% (1H25: negative 8.4%)


-   Significant solar roll out: 8MW (c. 60% increase) in solar generation within the next 12 months


Europe:


-   Stable performance delivering LFL earnings in line with prior year


-   Strong positive rental reversions of 16.3% and indexation of 2.6%, offset by increased vacancy within the portfolio to 14.8% as the strategic


    partnership prioritises capturing maximum estimated rental value ("ERV") growth over short-term vacancy


Australia:


-   Total investment income from real estate of R14m (1H25: nil) as asset management initiatives take effect and positive rental reversions


    are captured


Funds and asset management


-   2% increase in third party GAV


-   Fee income increased 70.6% to R58m and now represents 14.1% (1H25: 8.5%) of Group DIPS


South Africa:


-   Remain committed to SA Core Plus platform


-   Seeding platform with c. R5bn of retail and industrial assets


-   Platform LTV of 40%


Europe:


-   The successful completion of the Blackstone transaction last year represented the achievement of a key milestone for Burstone


-   Burstone's 20% co-investment and retained management mandate provides long-term alignment and earnings potential as the platform


    matures and performs in line with expectation


-   Assessing opportunities to establish additional 3rd-party fund platforms, expanding its capital partnerships


Australia:


-   Third party equity under management ("EUM") increase to A$668m (7% increase from FY25)


-   Fee income of R4m (1H25: R2m), expected to accelerate in 2H26


-   A$170m of new equity commitments from Australian capital partners to support platform growth will increase third-party GAV by c. 11%


Balance sheet highlights


-   The Group's pro-forma LTV at the reporting date was 39.0% (FY25: 36.3%) encompassing the effects of solar-related capital expenditure,


    further deployment for offshore investments, offset by SA asset disposals.


-   The Group will continue to target a leverage ratio of below 35% with a medium-term LTV outlook of between 34% and 36%, supported by continued


    capital recycling predominantly through SA asset sales.


-   R0.5bn of SA assets pending transfer.


-   A further c. R1.0bn to c. R1.5bn earmarked for sale within the next 18 months creates co-investment capacity to support R10bn of third-party


    GAV potential.


-   The Group has significant liquidity as it holds R1.3 billion in undrawn committed available facilities and cash, excluding proceeds from disposals that


    have yet to be completed.


-   Net asset value ("NAV") has decreased by 2.1% to R11.53ps (FY25: R11.78ps) largely as a result of mark-to market, amortisation and foreign exchange.


    Property-related valuations for the period have remained relatively flat, with nominal fair value gain recognised in respect of the various portfolios.

PROSPECTS AND GUIDANCE


The Group continues to execute its strategy, transitioning from a traditional property owner to a fully integrated international real estate investor,


funds and asset management business. The Group's performance reaffirms Burstone's progress over the past year in achieving operational stability


and scaling its funds and asset management business across its respective regions.


As a result, earnings momentum is building as underlying real estate performance strengthens and funds management growth gains traction.


Renewed focus on strategic operational alignment across geographies will yield cost efficiencies over the short- to medium-term. Balance sheet


strength remains critical to support Burstone's growth ambitions and fund platform scalability.


Real estate investment


South Africa:


-   South African portfolio is expected to continue to deliver similar LFL Base NOI growth for 2H26, underpinned by improved reversions and vacancy


    across the portfolio


-   Solar deployment pipeline of c. 8MW to be added to the portfolio within the next 12 months at compelling yields


-   c. R1.0 billion to R1.5 billion planned asset sales over the next 18 months


Europe:


-   Burstone's 20% co-investment in the approximately EUR1 billion PEL portfolio is expected to generate LFL earnings similar to the first half in


    2H26 amidst rental growth and positive reversions


Australia:


-   The current investments into initially low-yielding assets will offer strong reversionary potential as asset and capital management initiatives


    take effect


Funds and asset management


Europe:


-   Burstone aims to leverage its European footprint to expand its industrial and logistics exposure across key European markets


-   The Group continues evaluating additional opportunities to launch new fund platforms that will attract third party capital, building on its proven track


    record in the logistics and light industrial sectors, while leveraging the Group's existing European operations


Australia:


-   The additional A$170 million of equity from TPG will accelerate growth of the business


-   This expanded commitment underscores the strength of Irongate's performance, its disciplined investment strategy, and the confidence of global


    partners in Burstone's scalable, capital-efficient platform model


Balance sheet


The Group's balance sheet remains well positioned, providing flexibility to capitalise on future growth opportunities.


Capital optimisation remains a core focus for the business. In addition to creating balance sheet "firepower" through continued SA asset sales,


Burstone is exploring multiple funding avenues, including additional funds management platforms/strategies and the introduction of new limited


partner ("LP") capital to co-invest alongside Burstone across all markets.


Group outlook


Burstone remains committed to FY26 DIPS growth of between 2% and 4%, with the upper range, contingent on successful capital deployment.


While the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, management's prudent execution and disciplined approach continue to support


measured growth expectations.

1H26 INTERIM DIVIDEND


The Board seeks to maintain a dividend payout policy that supports its long-term strategy. For the six months ending 30 September 2025, the Board


has resolved to apply a payout ratio of 90%, declaring a dividend of 45.95989cps (1H25: 44.58034cps) an increase of 3.0% from 1H25.


The issued share capital of the Company at the dividend declaration date amounted to 804 918 444. The distribution will be made from income reserves.


Tax implications for South African resident shareholders


Dividends received by or accrued to South African tax residents must be included in the gross income of such shareholders and will not be exempt


from income tax in terms of the exclusion to the general dividend exemption contained in section 10(1)(k)(i)(aa) of the Income Tax Act because they


are dividends distributed by a REIT. These dividends are, however, exempt from dividend withholding tax ("Dividend Tax") in the hands of South African


resident shareholders provided that the South African resident shareholders have provided to the CSDP or broker, as the case may be, in respect of


uncertificated Shares, or the Group, in respect of certificated Shares, a declaration by the beneficial owner (in such form as may be prescribed by the


Commissioner) that the dividend is exempt from dividends tax in terms of section 64F and a written undertaking (in such form as may be prescribed


by the Commissioner) to forthwith inform the CSDP, broker or the Group, as the case may be, should the circumstances affecting the exemption


change or if the beneficial owner ceases to be the beneficial owner.


If resident shareholders have not submitted the above-mentioned documentation to confirm their status as South African residents, they are advised


to contact their CSDP, or broker, as the case may be, to arrange for the documents to be submitted prior to the date determined by the regulated


intermediary, or if no date is determined, by the date of payment of the dividend.


Tax implications for non-resident shareholders


Dividends received by non-resident shareholders from a REIT will not be taxable in South Africa as income and instead will be treated as ordinary


dividends which are exempt from income tax in terms of the general dividend exemption in section 10(1)(k)(i) of the Income Tax Act. It should be noted


that up to 31 December 2013 dividends received by non-residents from a REIT were not subject to Dividend Tax. With effect from 22 February 2017,


any dividend received by a non-resident from a REIT are subject to Dividend Tax at 20%, unless the rate is reduced in terms of any applicable


agreement for the avoidance of double taxation ("DTA") between South Africa and the country of residence of the non-resident shareholder.


Assuming Dividend Tax will be withheld at a rate of 20%, the net dividend amount due to non-resident shareholders is 36.76791cps. A reduced


dividend withholding rate in terms of the applicable DTA may only be relied on if the non-resident shareholder has provided the following forms to


their CSDP or broker, as the case may be, in respect of uncertificated shares, or the Group, in respect of certificated shares:


-   A declaration by the beneficial owner (in such form as may be prescribed by the Commissioner) that the dividend is subject to a reduced rate


    as a result of the application of the DTA; and


-   A written undertaking (in such form as may be prescribed by the Commissioner) to forthwith inform, the CSDP, broker or the Group, as the


    case may be, should the circumstances affecting the reduced rate change or if the beneficial owner ceases to be the beneficial owner.


If applicable, non-resident shareholders are advised to contact the CSDP, broker or the Group, as the case may be, to arrange for the


above-mentioned documents to be submitted prior to the date determined by the regulated intermediary, or if no date is determined,


by the date of payment of the dividend, if such documents have not already been submitted.
