LETTER FROM THE CEO


EXTENDING OUR STRIDE


FY25 saw Purple Group extend its stride, increase its cadence, and close the year with record pace and momentum.




Importantly, our magic remains: keep things Easy. Make investing fun, educational, engaging, and rewarding; remove


friction wherever we find it; meet clients where they are; and deliver to their growing needs with greater agility and


speed?while creating exceptional "wow" experiences. Do that, and more people join, and more people stay.




OUR SUCCESS IS ABOUT OUR CLIENTS


The longer clients stay with us, the more good habits stick: increased deposits, broader product adoption, smarter


diversification, and the confidence that comes from lived experience. This compounds into an incredible truth: over ten


years, the average client asset base grew ~14 times (~30% CAGR).




This year, we demonstrably evidenced the value of compounding at scale and accelerated growth across all value drivers,


while remaining disciplined in execution and grounded by the incredible runways for growth ahead.




PROOF, NOT PROMISES


"Talk is cheap. Money buys the whisky."




Last year I highlighted our scale advantage and the leverage we held over our cost base. This year, the income statement


walked the talk.




Every value driver delivered. Client behaviours compounded. And every line in our income statement evidenced our


progress?proving, durably, that purpose scales profitably with discipline and that distribution compounds with time.










THE FLYWHEEL, FASTER


Easy isn't just a platform; it's a flywheel of products, partners, clients, and shareholders working together to build more


value, faster. Purple Group is perhaps the best evidence of what's possible when all stakeholders are aligned in ambition


?united in purpose, transparent in execution, and robust in engagement. It's not always easy, but it moves all of us


toward our goals faster.




It's a digital highway?a financial super app?serving our clients' diverse wealth and asset-protection needs on their


journey to financial dignity and freedom.




Each year the flywheel turns faster?this year faster still?clear evidence that participation and trust are compounding.




GROWTH THEMES 2026


We don't build in the boardroom; we build from belief?the belief that comes from insights and observations of our


clients' needs and the friction we continue to uncover in their journeys. These themes are the operating system for value


creation in the year ahead. Each one is designed to lift at least one of our core drivers or remove a barrier preventing a


client from reaching a goal or ambition.




FY26 is about balance and intent, ensuring that the majority of our team, focus, and resources remain firmly on


protecting and growing what we've built, while our dreamers, architects, and builders are given the freedom to refine


what's not working with agility and autonomy, laying new rails for growth across products, partners, and global ambitions.




It's about refining rhythm, scaling what matters, and keeping the magic Easy?beautifully simple, powerfully effective.




What ties it all together is purpose, ambition, autonomy, trust, rhythm, and intent. Every theme builds on the next, one


reinforces another. When we get it right, outcomes compound.




Thrive as growth core


Thrive V3 rewards behaviours that build wealth?habitual deposits, diversification, education, and time on platform. As


rewards compound, retention deepens and Average Revenue Per User ("ARPU") rises?recurring economics earned, not extracted.




EasyRetire (Retail & Institutional)


Retirement is the longest relationship we hold. We're incentivising transfers and putting more marketing muscle behind


our scaling "Bring It All Home" campaign. We're simplifying touchpoints?onboarding, contributions, advice hand-offs?


so members stay engaged, funded, and invested. Advisor enablement and service excellence convert paperwork into


persistent client assets and trust.




Credit & Protect


Thoughtful risk products, priced by data and delivered in-product. We'll reward good behaviour and protect what clients


are building?lifting stickiness and ARPU without compromising affordability or simplicity. Wills and a new embedded-


insurance product in 2026 are designed to protect investor behaviour even when clients are no longer around.




EasyETFs, EasyBonds, EasyAI Baskets, EasyCrypto


Friction-free on-ramps, transparent pricing, and smart defaults help clients graduate from cash-heavy to portfolio-ready.


More baskets, more bundling, more non-activity revenue that compounds with assets and time.




Activity & Investing


EasyCrypto, EasyFX, and DIY Investing expand investor choice as crypto becomes institutionalised and global exposure


normalises. Record deposits and rising trading activity in USD and foreign wallets signal momentum. We'll streamline


cross-currency funding, tighten execution, and surface right moment nudges so activity compounds inside the ecosystem


?lifting ARPU while keeping Cost to Serve ("COS") in check.




Mortgage & Property Services


We aim to own more moments in the property wealth stack?from the first bond quote to portfolio-level exposure?


connecting our community and leveraging our scale for rental?management services.




EasyTrader inside Easy


For active users, EasyTrader now feels native: one identity, one wallet, one UX. We keep the pro tools while removing


switching costs, so activity stays in-ecosystem and feeds the same acquire-once economics.




Advisors & Ecosystems


Embedded distribution is our unfair advantage. Advisors, banking partners, telcos, and communities extend reach at low


Cost to Acquire ("COA"). Advisor workflows + partner rails turn distribution into a compounding loop, not a campaign.




This is the operating system of Easy.




STILL BREAKING RECORDS. STILL BREAKING THE MOULD.


Eleven years in, the privilege hasn't dulled; it's sharpened our focus and ignited our ambitions. The story stays simple:


show up for clients, remove friction, give them back time, and earn the right to serve them again tomorrow.


-  Operating leverage is showing up everywhere?revenue climbing, costs in check, and the business working efficiently


   at scale.


-  Clients are showing up too: consecutive record deposit months, accelerating inflows, improving retention, and stronger


   adoption across all products.




October gave us a glimpse of what's possible:


- Total deposits (ex-RISE/EasyRetire): R1.948 billion (new high; +R157 million vs April's record; more than 2 times October 2024)


- Retail deposits: R1.53 billion (record; +R298 million vs September 2025)


- Retail USD assets: passed R10 billion; USD revenue > $500k in October 2025


- Group client assets: new high-water mark R88 billion




With supportive macro conditions, expected rate cuts, and rising asset prices, the conditions to compound look strong.




STRATEGY, MADE PRACTICAL


1.   Remove friction in growth execution: automate the manual, simplify the complex, blast through blockers.


2.   Deepen client engagement: across the platform and product stack, deliver wonderful, unexpected easy moments.


3.   Scale leadership capacity: double the bench; lift cadence in engineering, product, growth, risk, finance.


4.   Monetise with discipline: lift Average Revenue Per User ("ARPU") while optimising COA/COS.


5.   Expand distribution & markets: integrated ecosystems at home; disciplined entries in Kenya and the Philippines;


     advisors and institutions that compound reach.




HOW WE WIN (VALUE DRIVERS)


- Active Clients: grow via integrated ecosystems and advisors (local and international); funded > registered.


- Client assets: lift per-client deposits, reduce outflows, broaden product use?make saving and investing the default.


- ARPU: bundle value and price fairly?subscriptions, advisors, credit, insurance, property services.


- COS/COA: automate, standardise, self?serve; build once, scale everywhere; target operating leverage.


- Market Expansion: sequence wins?license, localise, learn, then scale.




BOLD AMBITIONS ON THE WAY TO THE TOP 40


It's not business as usual.




Our Top 40 ambition is a declaration of intent, not a whimsical wish. It sets the direction and the standard.




We've moved from proving the model to scaling it?responsibly, profitably, and with increasing cadence.




We operate a world-class ecosystem, measured by the quality of the relationships we hold and the trust they place in us.




We've hard-wired ambition to accountability: goals that stretch us without losing sight of our purpose?making it easier


for everyone to create wealth and keep it.




Strategy is choice. Ours is guided by three questions:


1. Does this move us closer to our ambitions, including being a Top 40 company?


2. Does it stretch us beyond what we already know we can achieve?


3. Will clients, partners, and shareholders feel the impact when we succeed?




Our ambitions are anchored to our value drivers?we build only what compounds.




GRATITUDE


To Team Easy, who show up every day to make tomorrow's investing easier?thank you.




To our partners, especially the financial?services giants who open their platforms and their trust to us?thank you.




To our shareholders, for your incredible support and the long game?thank you.




To our Board, for your guidance, governance, and belief in our purpose?thank you for helping us steer the long course with clarity and conviction.




And to our clients, +1 million reasons to celebrate?thank you for choosing Easy. We'll keep earning it.




As we close FY25, the first year of our second decade, we look ahead with bold ambition and quiet discipline?the combination that compounds. We have the team, the platform, the partners, the plan, and the purpose to keep extending our stride?responsibly and durably.




Take it Easy
