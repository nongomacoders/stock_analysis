(1)  Short term guidance considers the year ended 31 May 2025 pro forma numbers as the base year


The Group's objective is to maintain a strong capital base to support growth, optimise leverage and


drive returns. Given the Group's expected growth in the medium-term, operational cash requirements


and the imperative to retain balance sheet flexibility in support of Cell C's growth strategy, the Group is


targeting an indicative leverage ratio of less than 1.0x (net debt to EBITDA) in the medium-term.
