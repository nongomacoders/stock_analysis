COMMENTARY


About Master Drilling


Master Drilling was established in 1986 and listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Limited (JSE) in 2012. The Group delivers innovative


drilling technologies and services. Master Drilling has built trusted partner relationships with blue-chip and mid-tier clients in the mining,


hydro-electric energy, civil engineering and construction sectors worldwide. The Company is exposed to various key commodities that ensure its


sustainability. The Master Drilling business model of providing drilling solutions and services to clients through tailor- made designs, coupled


with a flexible support and logistics chain, makes it the preferred partner throughout the life cycle of projects .


Commenting on the results for the six months ending 30 June 2025, Danie Pretorius, Chief Executive Officer of Master Drilling, said:


"Master Drilling is pleased to report a resilient first six months of 2025, achieving USD133.2 million in revenue, reflecting a 4.9% increase


compared to the same period in the prior year. This accomplishment comes against a backdrop of global market and economic uncertainty.


Despite some pressure on profitability, we extend our sincere gratitude for the unwavering support of our clients and business partners.


Our commitment to capital discipline remains a key driver of positive returns.


Master Drilling is dedicated to technological innovation. We are proud to see our new drilling and cutting technologies gain traction and make a


significant impact on the mining industry. Our vision of "making a difference" remains steadfast, as we strive to enhance safety, productivity,


and cost-effectiveness across the sector.


In addition to our core technologies, we have strategically invested in asset-light digital ventures. These initiatives, including proximity


detection solutions and integrated data and resource management systems tailored for mining operations, have not only improved our financial


performance but have also created new opportunities for the Group. These ventures ensure our continued relevance and solidify our position as a


leading innovator.


Leveraging our established relationships with clients and partners, alongside our global presence, has been central to achieving business growth.


By fostering these strong connections, we have been able to deliver a wider range of turnkey solutions, transforming Master Drilling into a more


comprehensive contractor.


The Company remains optimistic about the future. Nevertheless, we will continue to prioritise responsible practices, with a focus on cost control,


responsible capital allocation, and operational excellence."


Financial Overview


Revenue increased 4.9% to USD133.2 million and operating profit increased by 234.0% to USD26.6 million. These figures represent resilient results,


despite uncertain market, economic and operating conditions experienced globally.


During 2024 the Group provided for an impairment loss on the Mobile Tunnel Boring Machine, as no formal agreement was in place to project future


cash flows, due to uncertainty over commodity prices within the machine's target industry. During the first half of 2025, the Group finalised a


contract to commence operations of the Mobile Tunnel Boring Machine. This change in circumstances represents an indicator of reversal of impairment.


The Group has thus reassessed the recoverable amount of the asset and based on the contract's projected discounted cash flows, the recoverable


amount resulted in a partial impairment reversal of USD4.7 million from the impairment loss of USD7.8 million recognised in the prior year.


The balance of the impairment will be assessed on a continuous basis.


This partial impairment reversal of property, plant and equipment is the main driver in an overall increase in profit after taxation of 399.0% to


USD18.1 million.


USD earnings per share (EPS) increased 485.0% to 11.7 cents, and ZAR EPS increased 474,1% to 215,3 cents. USD headline earnings per share (HEPS)


increased 6.7% to 9.6 cents, and ZAR HEPS increased 4,7% to 176,6 cents.


Net cash generated from operations amounted to USD11.0 million. Cash resources continue to be managed diligently to cater for emerging opportunities


that require specific design, planning, and investment.


Master Drilling's total capital spend of USD13.9 million was applied as follows: 41% on expansion and 59% on sustaining the existing fleet.


Debt decreased from USD48.0 million to USD45.4 million. The gearing ratio, including cash, increased from 6.3% to 10.5% in the first six months of


the 2025 fiscal year.


Operational Overview


Safety and response to risk


Master Drilling has a comprehensive risk management program, which is managed through a collaborative platform. The company tracks the progress of


all mitigation measures, and any significant business risks are escalated to the executive team and the Board. A dedicated internal audit team


provides assurance that all actions are implemented and achieve their desired outcomes.


Our Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate for 2025 increased to 1.38 because of 2 Lost Time Injuries which occurred in the first half of the year.


The milestone is still above our tolerance level of 0.53. Detailed investigations were conducted into the incidents and specific entities were


identified for further safety intervention plans. Our priority remains to move people out of harm's way through innovative engineering solutions.


Throughout the year, the Group implemented a rigorous program in compliance with applicable ISO standards. This initiative involved a comprehensive


review of existing protocols, the implementation of new hazard identification measures, and a strong focus on upskilling and reskilling employees.


South America


The Group's operations in this region are experiencing significant growth and strategic development. The company is capitalising on a regional


transition towards underground mining and the increased focus on strategic minerals and ESG practices. Key initiatives include ongoing investments


in technological advancements and the successful deployment of new equipment. The Group is expanding its service offerings through a new strategic


joint venture and is actively pursuing new business with both existing and prospective clients, as demonstrated by strong financial performance and


a healthy pipeline of upcoming projects and tenders.


Central and North America


The Group's operations in this region are currently undergoing a significant turnaround, with particularly robust intervention plans that have


stabilised finances, resolved legacy issues, and positioned the region's profitability in recent years. The region is focused on organic growth


through technological adoptions and is actively pursuing market penetration with key industry players.


Africa


The Group's African operations are in a state of flux, with added pressure from a major project that has been placed on hold and from another


operation that has ceased as a result of diamond price pressures. However, a new contract has been awarded, prompting the mobilisation of additional


equipment. The Group anticipates strong, continued growth, with more machines being mobilised to key mines as well as a first-of-its-kind unit


successfully launched in this region. We have also been successful with a multi-year project, although this project has been deferred to 2026.


Rest of the World


This region exceeds expectations for profitability. This was achieved through efficient use of staff, cost-control measures, and successful project


execution. New contracts were awarded which provide multiple machines and services for growing clients.


Slim drilling


In the exploration sector, a research project was successfully implemented, while geotechnical drilling projects remain on schedule. The Group


has also secured a number of new contracts and is mobilising additional machines for various projects, including new contracts outside South Africa


and an expansion of underground drilling capacity at a major mine. Additionally, a new pilot micro-fracking project was successfully completed,


leading to an order for a second phase. While minor challenges exist, such as payment issues at a solar farm and a delivery delay for high-pressure


pumps, overall operations are progressing positively.


A strong emphasis is placed on technological advancements, demonstrated by the deployment, and testing of robotic drilling equipment and the


development of advanced sampling and processing systems with the commissioning of the Project Desert Elephant, our version of a surface core


drilling rig with a robotic hand which has been successfully completed. We are now in a position to finalise for production, which is in time for


upcoming proposals.


Other mining services


The Group's other mining service companies continue to out-perform expectations, with its strong focus on improving a safe working environment for


our clients' employees. The service offerings have been expanded further outside South African borders. Opportunities for global expansion will be


explored in the future.


Technology


Master Drilling is committed to continuous technological advancement as a key driver of client value and market competitiveness. To achieve this,


we have implemented a focused strategy that leverages targeted investments across our various technological divisions.


The Group is pleased to announce that the Mobile Tunnel Boring machine was successfully placed with a client in the South African region.


The contract negotiations have been finalised and operations are expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2025.


By investing in these cutting-edge technologies, Master Drilling is positioned to deliver safer, more productive, and cost-competitive solutions for


our global client base, optimising mineral recovery and information management throughout the mining lifecycle.


Operational equipment


The fleet consists of 148 raise bore, 35 slim drilling and one mobile tunnel boring rigs. The total raise boring fleet utilisation rate was around


65% while the slim drilling fleet utilisation was around 28%. The rate of new rigs coming on board will settle with a focus on larger units,


which typically generate higher income.


Our people


We prioritise building a highly motivated and engaged workforce. This commitment fuels our competitive advantage and delivers long-term value to


our stakeholders. We actively attract, develop, and retain top talent by fostering a safe and inclusive work environment. We celebrate the unique


perspectives and contributions of our diverse workforce, recognising that this synergy drives winning results.


Our commitment to fostering a thriving culture is unwavering. We continuously strive to refine our practices and ensure all employees feel valued,


empowered, and equipped to excel.


Outlook and prospects


Even in the face of global uncertainty, Master Drilling is confident in its ability to perform well. This confidence stems from several factors.


First, our long-term contracts provide a stable foundation for our business. Second, we have deliberately diversified our footprint across


various regions, commodities, currencies, and industries. This strategic approach mitigates risk and positions us for success in a complex global


environment. Proactive capital management is another key strength, ensuring we efficiently allocate resources to maximise returns. Finally,


our unwavering service orientation keeps client needs at the forefront of everything we do.


Currently, we are actively working to optimise our fleet utilisation, targeting a benchmark of 75%. Prudent capital management remains a core


principle that guides our decisions. Our diversification strategy, encompassing regions, commodities, currencies, and industries, has proven its


worth and will continue to be a central pillar of our growth plan.


The pipeline as at 30 June 2025 totalled USD515.0 million, while the committed order book totalled USD305.6 million for the remainder of 2025


and beyond. In the short to medium term, the sales pipeline is expected to stabilise and increase with further tactical acquisitions and joint


ventures supporting performance.


Looking towards the future, Master Drilling prioritises both safety and innovation. We are strong advocates for utilising advanced, mechanised


equipment, which aligns perfectly with the industry's growing focus on automation and remote operations. This commitment to cutting-edge technology


positions us competitively within this evolving landscape. Furthermore, we actively explore opportunities to expand beyond traditional drilling,


with potential applications for artificial intelligence being a key area of interest.


Investing in our people is another cornerstone of our success. We are committed to attracting and retaining top talent by fostering a positive work


environment and implementing best practices in human capital management. Finally, Master Drilling takes Environmental, Social, and Governance


initiatives very seriously. We believe that strong practices not only align with our values but also ensure long-term sustainability for our company


and contribute positively to broader industry goals.
