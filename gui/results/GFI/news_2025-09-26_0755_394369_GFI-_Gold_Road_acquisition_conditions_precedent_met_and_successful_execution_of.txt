Gold Road acquisition conditions precedent met and successful execution of Northern Star share sale


Gold Fields Limited


(Reg. No. 1968/004880/06)


Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa


JSE, NYSE, DIFX Share Code: GFI


ISIN Code: ZAE000018123


("Gold Fields" or the "Company" or the "Group")


COMPLETION OF CONDITIONS PRECEDENT WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITION OF GOLD ROAD


RESOURCES AND SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF NORTHERN STAR SHARE SALE


Gold Fields is pleased to announce that Gold Road Resources Limited ("Gold Road")


has received the requisite majority of votes from its shareholders in favour of the


proposed acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Gold


Road by Gruyere Holdings Pty Ltd (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company)


("Gruyere") by way of an Australian scheme of arrangement ("Scheme"),


("Transaction"). The Supreme Court of Western Australia ("Court") has also


subsequently made orders approving the Scheme and these orders have been lodged


with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Consequently, all


conditions precedent in respect of the Transaction have now been met and the Scheme


has become effective as of today, 26 September 2025.


Under the terms of the Scheme, Gold Road shareholders are entitled to receive a


final cash consideration equivalent to the value of A$3.06423 per Gold Road share


("Scheme Consideration"), comprising of the following:


   ?   a fixed cash portion of A$2.52 for each Gold Road share ("Fixed Cash


       Consideration"), less the fully franked special dividend of A$0.43694 per


       Gold Road share that was declared by the Gold Road Board on 16 September


       2025(1), resulting in a final Fixed Cash Consideration portion of A$2.08306


       per Gold Road share; and


   ?   a variable cash consideration, which has now been calculated and is the amount


       equal to each Gold Road shareholder's pro rata proportion of the value of


       Gold Road's shareholding in Northern Star Resources Ltd ("Northern Star")


       determined by the volume weighted average price of Northern Star shares traded


       on the ASX during the 5 trading days up to and including 25 September 2025,


       being the date immediately prior to the Scheme becoming effective ("Variable


       Cash Consideration"). Consequently, the final Variable Cash Consideration


       amounts to A$0.98117 per Gold Road share(2).


The Scheme Consideration values Gold Road's equity at approximately A$3.3bn


(excluding the special dividend) and implies a total enterprise value of


approximately A$2.6bn(3).


For further details on Gold Road's shareholder vote, the Court approval of the


Scheme, and the Scheme becoming effective, Gold Fields' shareholders are referred


to the announcements published by Gold Road, available on their website at


https://goldroad.com.au/.


It is expected that the Scheme will be implemented on 14 October 2025


("Implementation Date") and that the Scheme Consideration will be paid to eligible


Gold Road shareholders on the Implementation Date.


Gold Fields is also pleased to announce the successful monetisation of the


underlying shares acquired by Gruyere in Northern Star under the Scheme. Following


receipt of the Court approval for the Scheme and the finalisation of the Scheme


Consideration, Gold Fields, via Gruyere, entered into a Share Forward Transaction


("Equity Forward") with J.P. Morgan Securities plc ("J.P. Morgan Securities"),


pursuant to which Gruyere has agreed to sell the shares in Northern Star which it


will acquire as part of the Transaction. In connection with the Equity Forward,


J.P. Morgan Securities has sold Northern Star shares by way of a block trade at a


price of A$22.05 per Northern Star share, for total proceeds of A$1.1bn under the


Equity Forward. Upon receipt by Gruyere these proceeds will be utilised to repay a


portion of the acquisition financing bridge facility that will be drawn upon to


fund the Transaction.


Mike Fraser, Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields said:


"We welcome the achievement of these key milestones in Gold Fields' acquisition of


Gold Road.


This acquisition is a strategically logical, low risk opportunity to further improve


the quality of our portfolio through consolidation of a high-quality asset that we


already operate. We appreciate the partnership we have had with Gold Road and look


forward to further developing the potential of the Gruyere gold mine and Gold Road's


exploration packages to the benefit of Gold Fields' shareholders."


   (1)   Fully franked special dividend of $0.43694 per Gold Road share to be paid to Gold Road


         shareholders on Tuesday, 7 October 2025 (Special Dividend)


   (2)   Based on a 5-day VWAP of Northern Star shares of $21.77, being the applicable 5-day VWAP for


         Northern Star shares during the 5 trading days up to and including 25 September 2025, being the


         date immediately prior to the Scheme becoming effective


   (3)   Enterprise value based on market data as at 25 September 2025, which included Northern Star


         stake of A$1,116 million, other listed investments of A$17 million, cash and cash equivalents


         of A$232 million as at 30 June 2025, and a special dividend of A$478 million to be paid Tuesday,


         7 October 2025
