*Comparative numbers have been re-presented in accordance with the application of IFRS 5: Non-current Assets Held


for Sale and Discontinued Operations. The Group sold the assets of the Zimbabwean segment in December 2024. The


general merchandise business, the South African liquor business and the Mediland business were discontinued during


the June 2024 financial year.


Financial highlights


The Group's retail sales increased by 14.7% to BWP 9 107 million (2024: BWP 7 940 million), driven by 30


new stores, inflation and volume growth. Choppies segments saw volume growth of 8.7% and achieved


price growth of 5.1%. Choppies segments sales for like-for-like stores increased by 8.6%.


The gross profit margin improved by 40 basis points to 20.8% (2024:20.4%), due to improved margins in all


segments except Liquorama. The Liquorama gross profit rate reduced from 13.9% last year to 12.4% this


year as we faced heightened competition from both liquor retailers and liquor wholesalers and illicit liquor


imports hampered margin expansion.


In Pula terms, gross profit increased by 16.8% to BWP 1 893 million (2024: BWP 1 621 million) despite the


competitive and challenging economic environment.


Expenses increased by 21.8% due to new stores, inflation, the loss on the sale of the Zimbabwe segment


and impairment losses.


Operating profit (EBIT) decreased by 5.1% from BWP 335 million to BWP 318 million. In contrast, Adjusted


EBIT increased by 12.2% from BWP 344 million to BWP 386 million.


Net finance costs last year included a credit of BWP 6.5 million relating to the Kamoso acquisition and


excluding this, net interest reduced from BWP 112 million in the prior year to BWP 100 million. The


reduction was due to lower debt offset by higher interest on leases because of new stores.


The effective tax rate of 30.7% (2024: 14.8%) is higher than the standard rate mainly due to losses in


Namibia for which we have not yet raised deferred tax and non-deductible loss on the sale of Zimbabwe.


Last year's rate was lower than the standard rate due to deferred tax on carried forward tax losses in the


Zambia segment.


The Board has declared a final dividend (number 10) of 0.6 thebe per share, payable on 05 November 2025,


thus bringing the total dividend for the year to 2.2 thebe (2024: 3.0 thebe) per ordinary share. A separate


announcement relating to the salient dates and the tax treatment of the ordinary dividend will be released


on the BSE's X-News and on the JSE's SENS.
