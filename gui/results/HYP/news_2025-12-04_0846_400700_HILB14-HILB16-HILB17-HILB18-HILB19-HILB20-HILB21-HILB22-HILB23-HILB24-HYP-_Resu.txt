RESULTS OF ACCELERATED BOOK BUILD


Hyprop refers to its opening announcement, released on SENS on 3 December 2025, in which it proposed raising capital


of approximately R300 million under its general authority to issue shares for cash (the "Capital Raise"), pursuant to an


accelerated bookbuild and subject to acceptable pricing.


The book is now closed and was more than 4 times oversubscribed at a price of R54.50 per share (the "Issue price").


The Issue price represents a 3.20% premium to the 30-day volume weighted average price per Hyprop share of R52.81


and a discount of 3.7% to the closing price of R56.58 on 3 December 2025.


In light of the strong demand, Hyprop has increased the Capital Raise and accepted offers of R400 million at the Issue


price. Accordingly, Hyprop will issue 7 339 449 new Hyprop shares in terms of the Company's existing general


authority to issue shares for cash, at the Issue price.


Hyprop will use the proceeds of the Capital Raise as set out in its opening announcement and thanks participants for


their support.


Subject to approval by the JSE, the listing and trading of the new Hyprop shares is expected to commence at 09:00 on


Thursday, 11 December 2025.
