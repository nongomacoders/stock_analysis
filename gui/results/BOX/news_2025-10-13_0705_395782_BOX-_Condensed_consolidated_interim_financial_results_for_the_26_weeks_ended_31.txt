Highlights


- Turnover growth acceleration to 13.9%, up from 9.0% in H2 FY25 (pro forma 52 weeks)


- 5.3% like-for-like sales growth far outpacing selling price inflation, as a result of strong like-for-like volume growth


- Trading profit increase of 15.1%


- Trading profit margin maintained at 4.1%, despite extra costs incurred as a listed entity


- Net cash (excluding lease liabilities) of R1.1 billion, up from a net debt position of R180 million at February 2025


- Inaugural post IPO dividend declared of 45.30 cents per share, at a payout ratio of 40% of headline earnings per share


Introduction


H1 FY26 represented another strong trading period for Boxer, proving yet again that staying faithful to our vision of being the People's Champion by


continuously delivering low prices to our customers delivers great outcomes for all our stakeholders.


For the 26 weeks ended 31 August 2025 (H1 FY26), Boxer turnover grew 13.9% to R22.5 billion. Trading profit increased 15.1% to R931 million, at a trading


margin of 4.1%. The stable trading profit margin, despite additional ongoing costs related to being a listed entity, was driven by the strong trading result


and strong commissions and other income growth, as Boxer began to leverage data collection from its new customer loyalty programme, the Boxer Rewards Club.


H1 FY26 headline earnings grew 5.3% to R518 million, which Boxer considers to be a strong result given the drag on trading profit from costs associated with


being a listed entity, as well as a 79.1% increase in net finance charges (to R231 million) driven by the balance sheet restructure at the time of the IPO


and higher IFRS 16 lease interest due to expansion of the store estate. HEPS, however, declined 30.3% as a consequence of a 51.1% increase in the weighted


average number of ordinary shares (WANOS) due to the dilution from the 157.4 million shares issued in the IPO.


Cash dividend declaration


The Board has declared an inaugural interim dividend of 45.30 cents per share. This is in line with the pre-listing statement, whereby the Board


communicated its intention to pay a dividend from FY26 on a payout ratio of 40% of Headline earnings per share. The dividend will be paid on


8 December 2025. Please refer to the full cash dividend declaration below for more detailed information.


Outlook


After opening 25 new stores in H1 FY26, Boxer is on-track to achieve its target of opening 60 new stores on a full year basis. Despite the prevailing low


selling price inflation, Boxer's ability to achieve like-for-like volume growth has considerably supported the interim result, and bodes well for the full


year.


Boxer had a strong interim period, with trading momentum picking up in July and August. Trading momentum has remained strong in the six weeks post period


end. While recent trading is encouraging, the H2 FY26 result will largely be driven by trading over the critical Black Friday and Festive periods.


The Board is pleased that Boxer managed to hold its interim trading profit margin at 4.1%, despite incurring additional costs associated with being a listed


entity and expensing the IPO admission award. On a full year FY26 basis, the Board continues to anticipate some margin pressure relative to the 5.4% FY25


trading margin (52w pro forma basis), but this will ultimately depend on H2 trading outcomes.


Shareholders are reminded that Boxer's FY26 WANOS will increase by c.34% year-on-year to fully account for the IPO share issue. This IPO-related share


increase will likely result in a decrease in FY26 earnings metrics reflected on a per share basis, however, the full year impact should reflect a lower


decrease than that reflected above for H1 FY26 (where WANOS increased by 51.1%). Boxer continues to recommend that shareholders should focus on absolute


FY26 Headline earnings growth, which the Board feels more appropriately reflects operational performance.


Regardless of economic conditions, Boxer remains resolutely focused on operational execution to capture its substantial long-term structural growth


opportunity.
