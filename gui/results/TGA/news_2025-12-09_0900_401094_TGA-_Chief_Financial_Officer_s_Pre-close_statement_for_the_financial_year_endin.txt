Chief Financial Officer's Pre-close statement for the financial year ending 31 December 2025


Dear Stakeholder


At Thungela, we remain unconditional on operating a fatality-free business. We are


pleased that our business has now operated for nearly three years without a fatality, as


we remain focused on ensuring that our employees go home without harm every day.


As the production profile in South Africa transitions, with the closure of Goedehoop and


the successful ramp-up of Annea Colliery (previously known as the Elders project), as


well as the hand-over of the Zibulo North Shaft project to the operation, we are confident


that we will achieve approximately 13.7Mt of export saleable production, which is above


the guidance range of 12.8Mt to 13.6Mt. Our production momentum has also benefitted


from consistent rail performance and improvements by Transnet Freight Rail (TFR), with


an annualised 56.6Mt run-rate for the industry for the period ended 30 November 2025.


This reflects an improvement of 9% on the 51.9Mt delivered in 2024.


At our interim results in August 2025, we reported that in Australia(1), we had mined through


more challenging geology at Ensham during the first half of the year, which impacted


qualities and resulted in a higher stockpile of lower quality run of mine coal. Our marketing


team in Dubai successfully secured contracts for the lower quality coal which has resulted


in improved sales and lower stockpiles. Accordingly we expect to report export saleable


production of 3.8Mt at Ensham, which is within the guidance range of between 3.7Mt to


4.1Mt.


Global economic activity remains uncertain and influenced by the effects of tariffs and


persistent volatility surrounding international trade. These factors, such as inflationary


pressures, global economic sentiment and financial market volatility, continue to weigh


on overall growth. The impact of the stronger South African rand is also affecting the


competitiveness of South African exports.


Seaborne thermal coal prices remain depressed on the back of weak demand, caused


mainly by the uncertainty around the impact of tariffs and lower gas prices, while the


supply discipline that was expected, has not yet fully materialised. Demand from China


and India, the largest importers of thermal coal, remained below expectations for most of


the year, as a result of increasing domestic production and support for the growth of


alternative energy sources. Indian steelmakers faced growing competition from lower-


cost imported steel, which in turn reduced demand for South African coal and further


impacted prices. Increased gas and nuclear power generation in Japan, Korea, and


Taiwan further curtailed coal demand which contributed to Newcastle coal prices


recording a four-year low of approximately USD90 per tonne in September 2025.


Following these low coal prices across South Africa and Australia, we have observed


initial restocking at major import hubs and a gradual recovery in sentiment as reflected in


the forward price curves which are now in contango into 2026 and 2027.


The following are the key insights into our performance for the period 1 January 2025 to


30 November 2025 (the year to date(2)), and our expectations for the financial year ending


31 December 2025 (FY 2025(2)).


   ?   Benchmark coal prices have weakened in 2025 with the Richards Bay


       Benchmark coal price(3) averaging USD89.63 per tonne for the year to date,


       compared to USD105.30 per tonne for FY 2024(2). The Newcastle Benchmark coal


       price4 has averaged USD105.11 per tonne for the year to date, compared to


       USD134.85 per tonne for FY 2024.


   ?   Discount to the Richards Bay Benchmark coal price is approximately 15% for


       the year to date, compared to 13.1% for FY 2024. The average realised export


       price for product sold through the Richards Bay Coal Terminal for the year to date


       is USD75.89 per tonne, compared to USD91.56 per tonne for FY 2024.


   ?   Discount to the Newcastle Benchmark coal price has been approximately 1%


       for the year to date, compared to a discount of 8.0% for FY 2024. The average


       realised export price in Australia for the year to date was USD104.82 per tonne,


       compared to USD124.00 per tonne for FY 2024.


   ?   Export saleable production relating to our South African operations is


       expected to be approximately 13.7Mt for FY 2025, compared to 13.6Mt in FY 2024.


       This production performance reflects the continued ramp-up at Annea, strong


       performance at Mafube, offset by lower volumes from Khwezela which was


       impacted by abnormally high rainfall in the first half of the year.


   ?   FOB cost per export tonne excluding royalties for South Africa for FY 2025 is


       expected to be below the guidance range of between R1,210 to R1,290 per tonne,


       mainly due to a non-cash rehabilitation adjustment and strong production


       performance. The FOB cost per export tonne including royalties is also expected


       to be below the guidance range of R1,220 to R1,300 per tonne.


   ?   Export equity sales for South Africa is expected to be approximately 13.6Mt for


       FY 2025, compared to 12.6Mt for FY 2024. The increase was enabled by the higher


       export saleable production and improved rail performance.


   ?   Export saleable production at Ensham(5) for FY 2025 is expected to be


       approximately 3.8Mt (on a 100% basis), compared to 4.1Mt in FY 2024. The lower


       expected export saleable production in FY 2025 is mainly due to more challenging


       geology experienced in the first half of the year.


   ?   FOB cost per export tonne excluding royalties at Ensham for FY 2025 is


       expected to be within the guidance range of between R1,470 to R1,580 per tonne.


       Including royalties, the FOB cost per export tonne is also expected to be in the


       lower half of the guidance range of R1,650 to R1,780 per tonne.


   ?   Export equity sales for Ensham(5) is expected to be approximately 3.9Mt for FY


       2025, on a 100% basis, compared to 4.1Mt for FY 2024.


   ?   Capital expenditure for the South African operations for FY 2025 is expected


       to be approximately R2,600 million. This consists of R1,400 million relating to


       sustaining capital, which is at the lower end of the guidance range of between


       R1,400 to R1,700 million, and expansionary capital of R1,200 million relating


       mainly to the Elders and Zibulo North Shaft projects, which is at the upper end of


       the guidance range of between R1,100 to R1,200 million.


   ?   Sustaining capital expenditure at Ensham for FY 2025 is expected to be


       approximately R650 million (on a 100% basis), which is marginally below the


       guidance range of between R700 to R950 million (on a 100% basis).


The Group will undertake the annual assessment of the value of property, plant and


equipment (PPE) ahead of finalising the 2025 annual financial results. The assessment


requires significant judgement in relation to forward-looking market-related conditions,


specifically benchmark coal prices and foreign exchange rates, which are currently at


levels that does not support the carrying value of our PPE balances. We will update the


market once the assessment has been completed, which is expected to be before the


release of our annual results.


Portfolio optimisation in South Africa


Our South African portfolio is currently in a period of transition, with the closure of select


operations where coal reserves have reacher share and to the extent


required by the JSE Listings Requirements.
