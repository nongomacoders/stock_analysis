MESSAGE FROM JULY NDLOVU, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER


We are proud to report that we have operated for two and a half years without a loss


of life. This bears testament to our unwavering commitment to safety as our first


value. We remain unconditional about protecting the lives of our people.


The global operating environment was characterised by increasing geopolitical


uncertainties and tariff escalations disrupting global supply chains. These


uncertainties resulted in weak demand in key coal demand regions resulting in softer


prices, last seen during the Covid-19 pandemic. The financial results for the six


months ended 30 June 2025 however, demonstrate the strength of our balance


sheet, which has enabled the business to navigate the challenging market and


operating environments while maintaining a disciplined capital allocation approach.


We maintained our focus on controlling the controllables through increased


production in South Africa, notwithstanding the impact of abnormally high rainfall at


some of our opencast operations. In addition, our proactive approach in shielding the


business from currency volatility has contributed R1.4 billion to our earnings.


Our performance


Our financial results reflect the continued pressure on coal prices, with the average


realised export prices in South Africa and Australia declining by 11% and 10%


respectively. The softer coal prices, combined with a weaker US dollar to South


African rand exchange rate, have led to a decrease in Group revenue in the first half


of the year. Group revenue decreased by 12% year-on-year to R14.8 billion,


realising an adjusted EBITDA* of R691 million and net profit of R248 million. The


Group generated adjusted operating free cash flow* of R484 million for the first half


of the year, which was positively impacted by a working capital unwind of R690


million and cash inflows of R453 million generated from our continued focus on


managing foreign currency risk, resulting in net cash* of R6.3 billion at 30 June


2025.


The Group recorded export saleable production of 8.0Mt (on a 100% basis) for the


first half of the year. In South Africa, export saleable production increased by


approximately 300kt to 6.4Mt, mainly due to productivity gains at Zibulo and Mafube,


while production at Khwezela was impacted by abnormally high rainfall in the period.


Free on board (FOB) cost per export tonne excluding royalties* of R1,258 was in line


with the guidance range. Our full year guidance for export saleable production of


12.8Mt to 13.6Mt remains appropriate as production is seasonally weighted towards


the second half of the year. Consequently, guidance for FOB cost per export tonne


excluding royalties* of R1,210 to R1,290 also remains appropriate.


The South African coal industry continues to benefit from the improved rail


performance. In the first half of the year, Transnet Freight Rail achieved an


annualised run rate of 54.3Mt, compared to 51.9Mt for 2024. The improved rail


performance stems from the ongoing industry collaborative initiatives as well as


further optimisation projects, such as the signalling project, which are expected to


improve rail performance going forward.


Ensham achieved export saleable production of 1.6Mt (on a 100% basis), compared


to 1.9Mt (on a 100% basis) in the first six months of 2024. Production and export


saleable product qualities were impacted by challenging geology in the first half of


the year.


FOB cost per export tonne excluding royalties* of R1,694 was above the upper end


of the guidance range, as the mine incurred costs to produce run of mine tonnes


which have not yet been reported as saleable production due to quality variations. It


is expected that these tonnes will be reported as saleable production in the second


half of the year.


We expect production at Ensham to improve in the second half of the year, however,


given the geological conditions experienced, production is likely to be closer to the


lower end of the guidance range of 3.7Mt to 4.1Mt. Consequently, FOB cost per


export tonne excluding royalties* will be at the upper end of the full-year guidance


range of R1,470 to R1,580.


The Group's strategic projects remain imperative to the business, with Elders


beginning to produce export saleable production as we continue to ramp up. The


Zibulo North Shaft project is making good progress and is scheduled to be


completed in 2026, within budget. These two life extension projects are key to the


long-term sustainability of the business in South Africa, as the Goedehoop mine


approaches its end of life in 2025. At Isibonelo, the coal supply agreement is


reaching its end of contract term and the mine will thus come to the end of its life in


2025. We are evaluating opportunities to close these operations in a sustainable and


responsible manner. We continue to invest in the Lephalale Coal Bed Methane


project as we seek to demonstrate the value in use of the gas.


Navigating thermal coal markets


Geopolitical tensions and rising tariffs are significantly disrupting global supply


chains and constraining economic growth. Consequently, energy security has


become central to national economic strategies, driving an increase in domestic


production in key demand countries such as China and India. The impact of slowing


growth on coal demand, coupled with increased domestic production, has resulted in


high stockpile levels at major import hubs, leading to depressed prices.


Despite the lower demand for coal in the first half of 2025, coal production is likely to


remain at levels similar to 2024, driven mainly by higher in-country production in


China and India. On the other hand, production from Indonesia has slowed down as


a result of the lower coal prices and the impact of adverse weather conditions.


Production in Australia is also lower as a result of mine accidents and adverse


weather conditions in the first half of the year. Columbia's main coal producers have


recently announced a reduction in annual thermal coal production due to the low


coal price environment.


Looking ahead, the long-term coal fundamentals remain supportive, although


demand for the balance of the year remains contingent on the normal restocking


activities in the Northern Hemisphere. The slowdown in global economic growth may


result in coal prices remaining under pressure in the short term. In this scenario,


further production curtailment is likely to aid rebalancing of supply and demand in the


seaborne market.


Disciplined capital allocation


In the first half of 2025, we completed the share buyback announced in March 2025


for a total consideration of R328 million and also paid R1.4 billion in cash dividends


to shareholders. In February 2025, we acquired a further 15% interest in the Ensham


Mine for a total consideration of AUD48 million and we expect to own 100% of the


Ensham Business upon completion of the transaction with Audley Capital and


Mayfair.


The Group generated cash flows from operating activities of R1.2 billion for the first


half of 2025 and after investing R703 million in sustaining capital expenditure*, this


resulted in an adjusted operating free cash flow* of R484 million for the period. We


continue to cash collateralise our environmental liabilities over time, and have


contributed a further R188 million to the green fund in South Africa. At 30 June 2025,


the Group's net cash* position was R6.3 billion.


Our robust balance sheet position enables us to execute on our core strategic


priorities. We continue to reserve R500 million to complete the Zibulo North Shaft


project and a further R300 million to complete the Lephalale Coal Bed Methane


project.


The board remains committed to the dividend policy, which is to distribute a minimum


of 30% of adjusted operating free cash flow* to shareholders. The board has


resolved to return R421 million to shareholders, which comprises of an interim


ordinary cash dividend of R2 per share and a share buyback of up to R140 million,


subject to favourable market conditions. This represents a total return of 87% of


adjusted operating free cash flow* for the first half of 2025. The Sisonke Employee


Empowerment Scheme and the Nkulo Community Partnership Trust will also receive


a further R31 million collectively.


Given the weak coal prices, US dollar weakness and supply chain risks following the


ongoing trade and tariff uncertainty, the board considers it appropriate to maintain a


cash buffer of R5 billion. The Group holds undrawn credit facilities of R3.2 billion.


In conclusion


Thungela is currently in a period of portfolio change. The ability to successfully


execute on our strategic priorities will ensure that we reshape our business and


entrench resilience through the cycle. As we navigate ongoing complexities in the


operating environment and uncertainties in the macroeconomic landscape, we have


conviction in the outlook that high-quality thermal coal will continue to play a


fundamental role in the global energy demand.


Today represents a significant milestone in my journey as Thungela's chief executive


officer, as this is the last set of financial results that I will deliver. I am deeply grateful


to the Thungela board, Group executive committee, employees, shareholders and


stakeholders for your steadfast support. Together, we have built a sustainable


business with long-life assets across multiple geographies.


As we welcome Moses Madondo as the chief executive officer designate, I am


confident that Thungela is well positioned to continue to deliver on our purpose ? to


responsibly create value together for a shared future.
