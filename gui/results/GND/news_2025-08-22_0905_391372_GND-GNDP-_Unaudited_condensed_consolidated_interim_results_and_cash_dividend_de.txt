CORE BUSINESS


The first half of 2025 ("the period") was marked by a strong rebound in the second quarter, particularly in the Port and Terminals segment, following a slow


start to the year. Grindrod's operations were fatality-free during the period with a lost time injury frequency rate of 0.27 against a target of 0.40.


Key milestones on strategy execution were achieved.


The drybulk terminal operated by the Port of Maputo exported 6.5 million tonnes ("mt") for the period (2024 H1: 6.9 mt) whilst Grindrod's drybulk terminals


handled 7.9 mt (2024 H1: 8.4 mt). The monthly volume run-rate across all the drybulk terminals was 2.5 mt in the second quarter, up 13% from the first quarter,


reflecting a robust recovery particularly at Matola where record monthly volumes of 1.1 mt was achieved in May. Low rolling stock deployment, softer margins


on road transportation and subdued container and graphite volumes impacted the logistics segment.


The transaction to acquire the remaining 35% interest in the Matola terminal for R1.4 billion closed in May, and pre-tax cash of R901.7 million was


collected from exiting the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast property backed loans and advances, and Marine Fuels trading business. These actions resulted in one-


off items totalling R902.8 million, mainly consisting of foreign currency translation reserves released.
