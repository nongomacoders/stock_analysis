         supply agreement in place.


     o   PCZM mine dewatering and forced evaporation mechanical and electrical infrastructure successfully

         and forced evaporation of 100-140m3/hr.


     o   Civil construction of the 13ha water storage dam/Paddock 1 of the future 65ha tailings storage facility


         (TSF) at PCZM completed.


     o   Total Mineral Resource updated to 31Mt grading 1.2% Cu and 3.6% Zn for 370,000 tonnes of contained


         copper and 1,120,000 tonnes of contained zinc. This includes 20Mt of Indicated Resources at 1.22% Cu


         and 3.47% Zn.


?   Okiep Copper Project (OCP):


     o   DFS delivered for the Flat Mines Project, including the Flat Mine North, Flat Mine East, Flat Mine South


         and Flat Mine Nababeep deposits, delivering a post-tax NPV(at an 8% discount rate) of A$75 million

         1.3% Cu for 152,000 tonnes of contained copper. This includes Indicated Resources of 7.6Mt at 1.35%


         Cu.


     o   Confirmatory drilling completed at Flat Mine North, Flat Mine East, Flat Mine South and Flat Mine


         Nababeep.


     o   Water Use Licence granted for the OCP, Flat Mines Area, representing the final permit required to


         progress the OCP to construction and production.


COMMENTARY:


During the reporting period, Orion continued its transition to developer and operating mining company,


focused on the production of metals that are critical to the global clean energy transition, and which have


strong market fundamentals due to declining supply and grade profiles at major mines and a lack of investment


in the development of new mines. Orion's work programs focused on completion of the Definitive Feasibility


Studies (DFS) for the Company's flagship Prieska Copper Zinc Mine (PCZM) and Okiep Copper Project (OCP).


Each DFS was released on 28 March 2025.


PCZMs DFS considered an accelerated development strategy based on:


  ?   Initial "Upper-Level Phase" ? based on mining the near-surface supergene sulphide Resource block,


      which is accessible from an existing decline, with first production expected 13 months after start of


      construction and continuing for 4.3 years.


  ?   The "Deeps Phase" ? to commence following completion of mine dewatering, refurbishment of the main


      shaft and construction of the mining infrastructure. Mining of the Deeps has a life of mine (LoM) (life of


      mine from first production) of 11 years and will overlap with the last 2.2 years of the Upper-Level mining.


      This gives a combined LoM of 13.2 years.


Following the delivery of the Flat Mines DFS, potential has been identified to enhance the financial outcomes


through an optimisation process. The following areas are being optimised:


  ?   Earlier production from Flat Mine North (FMN);


  ?   Mining higher grades from FMN by improved selectivity;


  ?   Review of development layouts to reduce waste development;


  ?   Review of the Flat Mine South (FMS) Mineral Resource Estimate and mine design to include the 2024


      diamond drilling in FMS the results of which were unavailable for inclusion in the DFS; and


  ?   Value engineering targeting capital reduction.


Orion strives at all times to achieve a sustainable balance between intense operational effort and maintaining


a strong focus on safety, environment and community.


In addition, the following information is provided in accordance with paragraph 3.46 of the JSE Listings


Requirements:


  ?   Operating loss increased to a loss of AUD15.36 million (30 June 2024: operating loss of AUD7.94 million).


  ?   Basic loss per share increased by AUD0.09 cents to AUD0.18 cents (30 June 2024: basic loss per share of


      AUD0.09 cents).


  ?   Headline loss per share increased by AUD0.09 cents to AUD0.18 cents (30 June 2024: headline loss per


      share of AUD0.09 cents).


The operating loss for the reporting period was primarily driven by:


  ?   Contractor and advisor expenses of AUD1.72 million.


  ?   Exploration expenditure of AUD6.34 million which, under the Group's deferred exploration, evaluation


      and development policy, did not qualify to be capitalised and was expensed.


  ?   Finance income of AUD4.92 million, principally related to interest receivable on the Company's


      investment in preference shares issued to the Company (through its subsidiary Agama Exploration &


      Mining (Pty) Ltd by Prieska Resources Pty (Ltd).


The operating loss for the previous corresponding period reflected an unrealised foreign exchange loss of


AUD2.0 million and exploration expenditure of AUD4.24 million.
