Unaudited consolidated interim results


for the six months ended 30 June 2025


Nature of the business


Lighthouse is domiciled in Malta and listed on the Main Board of the JSE


Limited ("JSE"). The Group invests in dominant and defensive malls located


in large Western European cities with a strong economic underpin and economic


growth. A key component of the Group's strategy is to evolve and adapt malls


to cater for the ever-changing demands of retailers and consumers.


Distributable earnings and commentary on results


The board of directors of Lighthouse (the "Board") has declared an interim


distribution of 1.31220 EUR cents per share for the six months ended


June 2025, payable in cash. A detailed announcement, including salient


dates and the tax treatment applicable to the interim distribution, will


be published separately.


The distribution of 1.31220 EUR cents per share declared for this interim


period is 7.9% higher than the 1.21660 EUR cents per share of the comparable


prior period. The interim results reflect the accretive expansion of the


Iberian portfolio over the past 18 months following the disposal of the


Hammerson investment during 2024. The growth in distributable earnings was


achieved despite the negative impact of refinancing the borrowings secured


by Forum Coimbra during December 2024.

Outlook


Lighthouse remains dedicated to pursuing opportunities in its core markets,


prioritising leading retailers and dominant assets that deliver robust


risk-adjusted returns and consistent long-term income growth.


Acquisition growth is anticipated to moderate due to increased competition


for top-tier assets, driven by heightened interest from institutional


investors in retail real estate and a constrained supply of premium,


market-dominant properties.


The Iberian region is expected to maintain its strong economic performance


relative to broader Europe. Lighthouse's portfolio is strategically


positioned to achieve sustained increases in sales, footfall and net


property income, underpinning solid financial performance in FY2026.


Growth will be further bolstered in 2026 by full-year contributions


from recently acquired properties and delivering on value-enhancing


capital investments.


The Board confirms its FY2025 distribution guidance of approximately


2.70 EUR cents per share.
