VOLUNTARY ANNOUNCEMENT ? ACQUISITION OF HYPERMARKET UNIT AT ESPACIO MEDITERRANEO


ACQUISITION


Shareholders are referred to the announcement published on 30 June 2025, in which Lighthouse, through its wholly-owned


Spanish subsidiary, Mediterráneo Retail Property, S.L.U. (the "Purchaser"), acquired Espacio Mediterraneo (the "Mall") in


Cartagena, Spain. At that time, it was noted that the hypermarket unit occupied by Carrefour, measuring 13,549 m2 (the


"Hypermarket"), was under separate ownership and therefore excluded from the transaction.


Shareholders are now advised that, on 18 September 2025, the Purchaser entered into a notarial deed of sale with Frey


Mediterraneo, S.L.U. to acquire the Hypermarket for a gross purchase consideration of EUR 19.5 million (the "Acquisition"),


reflecting a net initial yield of 7% (excluding transaction costs). The Acquisition was structured as an asset deal, and ownership


of the Hypermarket unit transferred to the Purchaser on 18 September 2025.


RATIONALE FOR THE ACQUISITION


The Hypermarket unit is leased to Carrefour, the anchor grocery tenant of the Mall, providing Lighthouse with direct exposure


to Carrefour, one of Europe's leading supermarket groups.


The Acquisition enhances strategic and operational control of the Mall, enabling integrated asset management initiatives and


supporting long-term value creation through consolidated ownership.


The Acquisition is aligned with the Company's investment strategy, strengthening both the strategic positioning and financial


performance of the Mall, while further increasing the Company's exposure to the Iberian market.


CATEGORISATION


The Acquisition is not categorisable in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements and accordingly this announcement is


published on a voluntary basis in the interest of shareholders.
