REVIEWED CONDENSED GROUP FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2025 AND CASH


DIVIDEND DECLARATION


The Group has had a challenging financial year. Notable events over the reporting period ("FY 2025"):


    -   Commercial Pharmaceuticals, Aspen's core business segment comprising more than 70% of


        the Group's revenue, has delivered revenue and normalised EBITDA growth of 10% in constant


        exchange rate ("CER") underpinned by organic revenue growth in all three segments


        (Injectables, OTC and Prescription). This has been supplemented by the launch and rollout of


        Mounjaro® in South Africa, while also benefiting from the acquired product portfolio in Latin


        America. Reported performance has been diluted by the strength of the ZAR average exchange


        rates against Aspen's major trading currencies;


    -   Considerable progress has been made in executing the Group's generic semaglutide GLP-1


        strategy;


    -   The restructure of Aspen China and its integration with the acquired Sandoz business has been


        completed. Consequently, significant restructuring costs of circa R0,5 billion were incurred in


        H2 2025 as well as one-off inventory rationalisation and write-offs of R0,3 billion. These diluted


        the Group's Injectables gross profit margin percentage in FY 2025. This is expected to revert to


        normal levels in FY 2026. The restructured China business, supported by higher EBITDA


        margins, is now well positioned to contribute positively towards earnings growth in FY 2026;


    -   Manufacturing performance and intangible asset impairments have been negatively impacted


        by the material contractual dispute ("Dispute") announced on SENS on 22 April 2025, whereby


        shareholders were advised that normalised EBITDA from the Manufacturing business for FY


        2025 in CER would potentially be R2 billion lower than last guided in March 2025. The Dispute,


        the details of which are subject to contractual confidentiality, relates to a manufacturing and


        technology agreement with a contract manufacturing customer for mRNA products. As a


        consequence of the Dispute and related risks, normalised EBITDA from the Manufacturing


        business for FY 2025 of R0,7 billion in CER was 38% of that reported in FY 2024. The Dispute is


        now the subject of a contractually prescribed adjudication process;


    -   Aspen is pleased to report that the validation stage of the insulin contract has been


        successfully completed in our South African sterile facility. In anticipation of regulatory


        approvals being received shortly, commercial production has already been initiated;


    -   The retrospective implementation of global minimum tax legislation in South Africa coupled


        with the announcement by the Mauritian government of a Qualified Domestic Minimum Top


        Up Tax ("QDMTT") of 15%, effective from FY 2025, has negatively impacted both Commercial


        Pharmaceuticals intangible asset valuations and Group effective tax rates. As guided


        previously, higher Group effective tax rates are expected to be sustained. The QDMTT has


        materially increased the tax rate used for Commercial Pharmaceuticals brand related


        intangible asset valuations increasing impairments by R1,7 billion. These intangible assets are


        only impaired if the individual brand asset value is below carrying amount and are not revalued


        above cost where their individual brand value exceeds carrying amount. Despite the negative


        impact of the QDMTT, total brand related intangible assets still have a valuation of more than


        50% greater than their carrying amount;


    -   The abovementioned intangible asset impairments totalling R4,1 billion, which comprises the


        QDMTT related impact of R1,7 billion, the mRNA asset impairment of R0,8 billion and regional


        performance related impairments of R1,6 billion, have resulted in the Group incurring a loss


        for the year. These impairments and the increased restructuring costs have adversely impacted


        Aspen's earnings per share ("EPS") and headline earnings per share ("HEPS") as compared to


        the Group's primary measure of performance being normalised headline earnings per share


        ("NHEPS");


    -   Operating cash conversion rate of 147% well exceeded the Group's target of 100%. The


        leverage ratio ended at 3.2x. Net debt of R31,2 billion was marginally higher than the R30,0


        billion in H1 2025, negatively affected by the weaker ZAR year-end closing rates partly offset


        by the stronger second half CER operating cash flows and lower inventory levels; and


    -   Finance costs benefited from interest rate cuts across the Group's EUR, ZAR and AUD debt


        pools in the second half of the year. Despite this, year-on-year finance costs have risen,


        influenced by higher net debt levels and increased foreign exchange losses driven by US tariff-


        led global volatility in exchange rates.

SEGMENTAL PERFORMANCE


Commercial Pharmaceuticals


Commercial Pharmaceuticals delivered solid revenue growth of 5% (10% CER) to R32 216 million and


normalised EBITDA growth of 1% (10% CER) with CER EBITDA growth well aligned to CER revenue


growth despite absorbing proportionately higher operating expenses in the business acquired from


Sandoz in China. Organic revenue growth of 7% CER was achieved when excluding the portfolio


acquired in Latin America. Gross profit margins of 58,1% (FY 2024: 59,4%) were diluted by lower


Injectables gross profit margins and the relative strength of the average ZAR exchange rates against


Aspen's major trading currencies.


Prescription


Prescription Brands reported growth of 10% (16% CER), with revenue of R12 519 million. Americas led


the growth, benefitting from the full year addition of the portfolio acquired in Latin America which


enjoyed double digit growth on a comparable basis in H2 2025. Africa Middle East, the largest region


within this segment, grew 8% with solid organic growth of 6% augmented by the Lilly franchise. Gross


profit percentage of 61,8% (FY 2024: 60,9%) was supported by a favourable sales mix from Americas.


OTC


OTC revenue grew by 1% (5% CER) to R9 812 million buoyed by an expected stronger second half


performance from Africa Middle East which recorded full year growth of 5% (6% CER). The Australasia


OTC portfolio revenue, which grew 5% in CER, now exceeds the region's Prescription segment and is


well positioned for future growth. Gross profit percentage of 58,3% was closely aligned to the prior


period (FY 2024: 58,7%).


Injectables


The Injectables portfolio returned to growth in FY 2025 rising 4% (10% CER) to R9 885 million. Africa


Middle East growth of 45% was boosted by the successful launch and rollout of Mounjaro® in South


Africa. The product swop transaction with Sandoz impacted Asia positively and Europe negatively.


Gross profit percentage declined to 53,2% (FY 2024: 58,2%) influenced by the impact of national


volume-based procurement and related one-off inventory write-offs in China.


Manufacturing


Manufacturing revenue of R11 147 million ended 21% lower (-19% CER). Reduced revenue from


Heparin was the main cause of this decline as the business benefitted from high once-off sales in the


prior year due to the transition to a working capital light toll model. Normalised EBITDA of R668 million


in CER ended 62% lower than the prior year impacted mainly by the Dispute within the Finished Dose


Form ("FDF") segment.


PROSPECTS


Aspen is focused on optimisation strategies for its Manufacturing business and building on the gains


made in Commercial Pharmaceuticals.


For FY 2026, Commercial Pharmaceuticals is expected to record mid-single digit organic revenue and


stronger EBITDA growth in CER. This will be supported by a higher profit contribution from the


reshaped business in China and further incremental growth from Mounjaro® in South Africa following


the recent regulatory approval of the Kwikpen® delivery system indicated for type 2 diabetes


management and pending approval of the chronic weight management indication. Aspen has also


recently concluded a long-term distribution and promotional agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim


for its product portfolio in South Africa, effective from 1 September 2025.


Considerable progress has been made in executing on Aspen's generic semaglutide GLP-1 strategy


(sterile injectable products for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity). This has required


extensive investment in both intellectual property("IP") and infrastructure. To give the Group every


chance of success, Aspen has followed a strategy of both developing its own IP and


licensing/partnering on IP with licensors. It is anticipated that the first revenue from this initiative


could be as early as the latter part of FY 2026. No such revenue has been included in the Commercial


Pharmaceuticals guidance detailed above.


The FDF segment of the Manufacturing business is working to recover lost profitability by FY 2027. Key


to achieving this objective is:


    -   Commercialising the insulin 10% CER) to R32 216 million and


normalised EBITDA growth of 1% (10% CER) with CER EBITDA growth well aligned to CER revenue


growth despite absorbing proportionately higher operating expenses in the business acquired from


Sandoz in China. Organic revenue growth of 7% CER was achieved when excluding the portfolio


acquired in Latin America. Gross profit margins of 58,1% (FY 2024: 59,4%) were diluted by lower

could be as early as the latter part of FY 2026. No such revenue has been included in the Commercial


Pharmaceuticals guidance detailed above.


The FDF segment of the Manufacturing business is working to recover lost profitability by FY 2027. Key


to achieving this objective is:


    -   Commercialising the insulin contract, following an intensive technical transfer process. This is


        an exciting opportunity for both Aspen and patients. Resultant revenue of R0,3 billion is


        forecast for FY 2026, ramping up to more than R1 billion for FY 2027; and


    -   Reshaping both Aspen's French and South African sterile facilities to match resources with the


        existing contracts on hand. It is intended that most of the restructuring will be addressed in


        this calendar year.


The benefits of both increased revenue and cost reductions will positively impact H2 2026 and are


expected to be fully realised in FY 2027.


Aspen is well positioned to execute on its strategic opportunities that will further enhance


Manufacturing profitability which include, inter alia:


    -   Procuring regulatory approval from SAHPRA and WHO for the Serum paediatric vaccines, to


        be followed by commercialisation with potential sales in calendar year 2026 and increased


        volumes thereafter;


    -   On-boarding GLP-1 injectable production volumes at both the French and South African sterile


        facilities following the operationalisation of Aspen's generic semaglutide strategy; and


    -   Securing further contracts in the South African and French sterile facilities.


The Group anticipates double digit CER growth in normalised headline earnings in FY 2026.


Manufacturing normalised EBITDA was positively impacted by the contribution from the mRNA


contract in H1 2025 but negatively impacted by the reversal of a portion of this contribution in H2 2025


following the onset of the Dispute. Consequently, the relative CER normalised headline earnings are


expected to be lower in H1 2026 followed by stronger double-digit growth in H2 2026.


The continued focus on working capital, enhanced Manufacturing efficiencies and expected lower


investment in capital expenditure (following higher GLP-1 and sterile related investments in FY 2025)


should assist the Group in reducing net debt levels and achieving an operating cash conversion rate


target of greater than 100% in FY 2026. The Group expects to achieve a leverage ratio of less than 3.0x


at the end of FY 2026.
