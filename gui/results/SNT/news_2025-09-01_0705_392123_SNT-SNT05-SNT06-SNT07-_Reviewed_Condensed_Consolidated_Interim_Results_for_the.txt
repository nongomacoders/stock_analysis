KEY PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS


Santam delivered a strong first-half performance, exceeding the longer-term targets for all key financial performance


indicators.


An interim dividend of 590.00 cents per share was declared, up 10.3% compared to the previous period. Earnings and


headline earnings per share increased by 19.5% and 18.7%, respectively.


Strategy


Our focused approach to delivering on our strategy is yielding positive results across our segments, despite the


challenging operating environment.


We are building a foundation to accelerate international expansion and diversification, with in-principle approval


received to set up Santam Syndicate 1918 at Lloyd's.


Conventional insurance


An underwriting margin of 11.3% was achieved in the first half of 2025, with solid contributions from both personal and


commercial lines. All businesses exceeded their 2024 performance.


The risk profile and rating strength of the in-force book improved over the last two years, following underwriting


actions implemented at Broker Solutions, Client Solutions and Santam Re.


These actions produced positive earnings momentum, which was further augmented by benign attritional losses and an


absence of weather-related catastrophes.


Alternative Risk Transfer (ART) business


The ART business achieved another sterling performance, growing its profit contribution by 28%. This is the result of


improved operating earnings, supported by growth across most of the main income lines, as well as an increase in


investment return earned on capital.


International strategic investments


Net insurance result from our participation in Sanlam's Indian and Malaysian businesses increased by 18%. Shriram


General Insurance (India) was the primary contributor, with solid growth from all distribution channels.
