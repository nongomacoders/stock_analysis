Hendrik du Toit, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, commented:


"Over this reporting period business conditions have continued to improve. The combination of strong markets, competitive


investment returns, net inflows and ongoing cost control has delivered healthy earnings growth. We see early evidence of a


demand recovery for emerging markets and differentiated active investment management. We are well positioned for this.


We are pleased to report that the Sanlam relationship is already delivering. The UK transaction was completed in June 2025,


with the South African transaction (which has received all regulatory approvals) to follow later this financial year.


Whilst doubling down on our core markets and offerings, we are also investing in exciting growth initiatives and in our


technology platform. Our focus remains on investing and serving our clients to the highest possible standards.


Ninety One's clarity of strategy and simplicity of model enable us to seize the opportunity with pace and strength."


Outlook


The business is stronger than in the previous reporting period. We are operating in an environment where emerging markets


are back on the radar of major asset owners and active investment management is regaining relevance. Ninety One's clarity


of strategy and simplicity of model position us to respond with conviction.


Having weathered the challenges of recent years, we see renewed opportunity for growth and remain firmly focused on


building the active investment manager of the future with pace and intensity.
