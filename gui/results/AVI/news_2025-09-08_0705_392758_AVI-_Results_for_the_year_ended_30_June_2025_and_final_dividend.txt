Final dividend


Notice is hereby given that a gross final ordinary dividend No. 107 of 406 cents per share for the year ended


30 June 2025 has been declared payable to shareholders of ordinary shares. The dividend has been declared out


of income reserves and will be subject to dividend withholding tax at a rate of 20%. Consequently, a net final


dividend of 324,8 cents per share will be distributed to those shareholders who are not exempt from paying


dividend tax. In terms of dividend tax legislation, the dividend tax amount due will be withheld and paid over


to the South African Revenue Services by a nominee company, stockbroker or Central Securities Depository


Participant ("CSDP") (collectively "regulated intermediary") on behalf of shareholders. However, all shareholders


should declare their status to their regulated intermediary, as they may qualify for a reduced dividend tax rate or


exemption. AVI's issued share capital at the declaration date is 340 146 466 ordinary shares. AVI's tax reference


number is 9500/046/71/0. The salient dates relating to the payment of the dividend are as follows:


Last day to trade cum dividend on the JSE              Tuesday, 14 October 2025


First trading day ex dividend on the JSE               Wednesday, 15 October 2025

cheques and all payments will only be made into a nominated bank account by electronic funds transfer. Shareholders


who have not yet provided their bank account details to Computershare Investor Services Proprietary Limited are


reminded to contact Computershare on 0861 100 950 with their bank account details into which the dividends can be
