AngloGold Ashanti Q2 and Six Months Ended 30 June 2025 Earnings Release and Dividend Declaration


AngloGold Ashanti posts strong Q2 2025 YoY- Gold production +21%; AISC* continues to remain flat in real


terms for managed operations; Free cash flow* rises 149% to $535m; Adjusted net debt falls 92% to $92m;


Dividend of 80 cps; Russell US Indexes inclusion


London, Denver, Johannesburg, 1 August 2025 ? AngloGold Ashanti plc(2) ("AngloGold Ashanti", "AGA", the "Company" or the


"Group") said earnings and free cash flow* more than doubled year on year in Q2 2025, driven by the average gold price received


per ounce*(6), continued cost discipline and a 21% increase in gold production, following another strong performance from its


managed operations.


The Company generated $535m in free cash flow*(5) in Q2 2025, a 149% year-on-year increase from $215m in Q2 2024. The 25%


year-on-year rise in gold production from managed operations(1)(2)(3) was supported by strong contributions from Obuasi, in Ghana,


and Geita, in Tanzania, and the addition of the Sukari gold mine(2) in Egypt. The average gold price received per ounce*(6)


increased to $3,287/oz in Q2 2025, from $2,330/oz in Q2 2024.


The Company maintained its strong safety performance, with a Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate ("TRIFR") of 0.80 injuries


per million hours worked in Q2 2025, an improvement of 17% year-on-year and well below industry benchmarks.


"This is another strong result that again demonstrates our focus on cost control and the positive momentum we're building across


the business," said CEO Alberto Calderon. "We're reaping the benefit of consistent production and cash flow growth, supported by


disciplined capital allocation."


AngloGold Ashanti remains committed to closing the valuation gap with its North American peers by driving continuous


improvements in operating performance, enhancing cash conversion, extending mine lives, and maintaining discipline in allocating


capital.


The Company actively manages its portfolio, completing the disposal of its Archean-Birimian Contact ("ABC") and Doropo projects


in Côte d'Ivoire in May, and announcing in June the proposed sale of its Serra Grande mine in Brazil. AngloGold Ashanti continues


to consolidate the Beatty District in Nevada, including the proposed acquisition of Augusta Gold, which will strengthen its position in


the most significant emerging gold district in the US and enhance its ability to develop the region under a unified regional plan.


Dividend demonstrates confidence, strong cash flow


An interim dividend of 80 US cents per share was declared for Q2 2025, which includes the minimum quarterly dividend of $63m or


12.5 US cents, with the balance reflecting our decision to pay half of free cash flow* generated for the six months through to 30


June. While our dividend policy commits to this 'true up' payment to 50% of free cash flow* annually at year-end, the Company's


board used its discretion to make the payment at the half year given the strength of cash flows and its confidence in the outlook.


Russell Indexation to boost liquidity


In June, AngloGold Ashanti was added to the Russell 1000®, Russell 3000®, and Russell Midcap® Indexes following the 2025


FTSE Russell reconstitution. These inclusions mark another important milestone for the Company since its primary listing on the


New York Stock Exchange in late 2023, further enhancing visibility among US institutional investors and access to a deeper pool of


capital, driving improvements in liquidity and breadth of ownership.


Balance sheet strengthened by earnings and cash flow


AngloGold Ashanti has continued to strengthen its balance sheet, with Adjusted net debt* down 92% year-on-year to $92m, and the


ratio of Adjusted net debt* to Adjusted EBITDA* improving to 0.02x, from 0.62x a year earlier. The Group ended Q2 2025 with


liquidity of $3.4bn, including $2.0bn in cash and cash equivalents.


Adjusted EBITDA* increased 111% year-on-year to $1.44bn in Q2 2025, from $684m in Q2 2024. Headline earnings(4) rose to


$639m, or $1.25 per share, in Q2 2025, compared to $255m, or $0.60 per share, in Q2 2024 ? an increase of 151% and 108%


year-on-year, respectively. Net cash flow from operations rose 142% to $1.02bn in Q2 2025, from $420m in Q2 2024, boosting free


cash flow* for the quarter.


Momentum continued at managed operations(1)


Gold production for the Group(1)(2)(3) increased by 21% year-on-year to 804,000oz in Q2 2025, up from 663,000oz in Q2 2024. This


growth reflects the contribution from Sukari and improved performances at key assets, including Obuasi (+31%), Geita (+20%),


Cerro Vanguardia (+7%), Cuiabá (+6%) and Siguiri (+6%). The TRIFR improved 17% year-on-year to a record low of 0.80 injuries


per million hours worked in Q2 2025 versus 0.96 in Q2 2024.


Managed operations(1) drove the outperformance for Q2 2025, with gold production up 25% year-on-year to 729,000oz, compared


to 581,000oz in Q2 2024. The increase was partially offset by lower output from non-managed joint ventures(1), which declined 9%


year-on-year to 75,000oz, mainly due to lower tonnes processed and lower grades at Kibali.


Production improvements were led by Geita, which continues to deliver consistently strong operating results, and Obuasi, where


the ramp-up of underhand drift-and-fill mining ("UHDF") progressed on schedule, supporting the 21% year-on-year increase in


grade. Siguiri, Cerro Vanguardia, and Cuiabá also posted modest gains. These were partly offset by declines at Iduapriem, Serra


Grande and Tropicana, while Sunrise Dam held broadly steady.


Total cash costs* for the Group(1)(2) increased by 8% year-on-year to $1,226/oz in Q2 2025 from $1,137/oz in Q2 2024, while all-in


sustaining costs* ("AISC") rose 7% to $1,666/oz in Q2 2025, from $1,560/oz in Q2 2024. For managed operations(1), total cash


costs* rose 6% year-on-year to $1,241/oz in Q2 2025 from $1,171/oz in Q2 2024, while AISC* rose 4% to $1,694/oz in Q2 2025


from $1,626/oz in Q2 2024. These increases were driven primarily by a 28% increase in sustaining capital expenditure*, inflationary


cost pressures of approximately 5%, and a $60/oz average increase in the overall royalty charge linked to the higher gold price.


These factors were partly offset by higher gold sales volumes.


Total capital expenditure for the Group(1)(2) rose to $381m in Q2 2025, up 33% year-on-year from Q2 2024, with sustaining capital


expenditure* increasing 28% year-on-year to $273m. The increase in sustaining capital expenditure* reflects the inclusion of Sukari


and ongoing investment to support asset integrity and long-term operational resilience, in line with strategic priorities.


Reaffirming guidance


Full-year 2025 guidance remains unchanged. AngloGold Ashanti remains focused on maintaining gold production and cost


guidance for the full year and is executing on its strategic priorities, including enhancing margins, extending mine lives, and


maintaining capital discipline.

      The term "managed operations" refers to subsidiaries managed by AngloGold Ashanti and included in its consolidated reporting, while the term "non-managed joint


      ventures" (i.e., Kibali) refers to equity-accounted joint ventures that are reported based on AngloGold Ashanti's share of attributable earnings and are not managed


      by AngloGold Ashanti.


      Managed operations are reported on a consolidated basis. Non-managed joint ventures are reported on an attributable basis.

      On 22 November 2024, the acquisition of Centamin plc ("Centamin") was successfully completed. Centamin has been included from the effective date of the


      acquisition.


(3)


      Includes gold concentrate from the Cuiabá mine sold to third parties in Q2 2024.


(4)


      The financial measures "headline earnings (loss)" and "headline earnings (loss) per share" are not calculated in accordance with IFRS® Accounting Standards, but


      in accordance with the Headline Earnings Circular 1/2023, issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA), at the request of the


      Johannesburg Stock Exchange Limited (JSE). These measures are required to be disclosed by the JSE Listings Requirements and therefore do not constitute Non-


      GAAP financial measures for purposes of the rules and regulations of the US Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") applicable to the use and disclosure of


      Non-GAAP financial measures.


(5)


      To enhance comparability with industry peers, AngloGold Ashanti has revised its definition of free cash flow*, which is a Non-GAAP financial measure. Pursuant to


      its revised definition, free cash flow* is calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditure. Operating cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating


      activities, plus repayment of loans advanced to joint ventures, less dividends paid to non-controlling interests (i.e., dividends paid to non-controlling interests in


      Sukari (50%), Siguiri (15%) and Cerro Vanguardia (7.5%)). Free cash flow* figures for prior periods (including Q2 2024 and H1 2024) have been adjusted to reflect


      this change in reporting.


(6)


      The average gold price received per ounce* for Q2 2024 and H1 2024 has been restated to be based on the gold revenue from primary operating activities.


      Previously, the gold price received per ounce calculation included revenue from normal operating activities as well as hedging activities.

regarding gold prices, production, total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, cost savings and other operating results, return on equity, productivity improvements, growth prospects and outlook of


AngloGold Ashanti's operations, individually or in the aggregate, including the achievement of project milestones, commencement and completion of commercial operations of certain of AngloGold


Ashanti's exploration and production projects and the completion of acquisitions, dispositions or joint venture transactions, AngloGold Ashanti's liquidity and capital resources and capital


expenditures and the outcome and consequences of any potential or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings or environmental, health and safety issues, are forward-looking statements


regarding AngloGold Ashanti's financial reports, operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward-looking statements or forecasts are not based on historical facts, but


rather reflect our current beliefs and expectations concerning future events and generally may be identified by the use of forward-looking words, phrases and expressions such as "believe",


"expect", "aim", "anticipate", "intend", "foresee", "forecast", "predict", "project", "estimate", "likely", "may", "might", "could", "should", "would", "seek", "plan", "scheduled", "possible", "continue",


"potential", "outlook", "target" or other similar words, phrases, and expressions; provided that the absence thereof does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Similarly, statements that


describe our objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements or forecasts involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors


that may cause AngloGold Ashanti's actual results, performance, actions or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance, actions or achievements expressed or


implied in these forward-looking statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and forecasts are reasonable, no assurance


can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Accordingly, results, performance, actions or achievements could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking


statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in economic, social, political and market conditions, including related to inflation or international conflicts, the success of business and


operating initiatives, changes in the regulatory environment and other government actions, including environmental approvals, fluctuations in gold prices and exchange rates, the outcome of


pending or future litigation proceedings, any supply chain disruptions, any public health crises, pandemics or epidemics, the failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or


effective disclosure controls and procedures, the inability to remediate one or more material weaknesses, or the discovery of additional material weaknesses, in the Company's internal control over


financial reporting, and other business and operational risks and challenges and other factors, including mining accidents. For a discussion of such risk factors, refer to AngloGold Ashanti's annual


report on Form 20-F for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These factors are not necessarily all of the important


factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti's actual results, performance, actions or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Other unknown or


unpredictable factors could also have material adverse effects on AngloGold Ashanti's future results, performance, actions or achievements. Consequently, readers are cautioned not to place undue


reliance on forward-looking statements. AngloGold Ashanti undertakes no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or


circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by applicable law. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements


attributable to AngloGold Ashanti or any person acting on its behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements herein.
