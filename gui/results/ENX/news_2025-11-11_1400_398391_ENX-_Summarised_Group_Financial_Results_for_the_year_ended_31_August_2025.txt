#  The prior period has been restated due to the classification of enX's Lubricants segment (AG Lubricants) and enX's Chemicals segment (WAG)


   as disposal groups held for sale and discontinued operations as at 1 December 2024 and 30 June 2025 respectively. The prior year's EPS, Diluted


   EPS and HEPS remain unchanged on a total operations basis. The split between continuing and discontinued operations, has however changed due


   to AG Lubricants and WAG being classified as disposal groups held for sale and discontinued operations.


During the financial year, enX completed the disposal of the Lubricants segment, unlocking R288 million in gross proceeds and this, together


with surplus unrestricted cash from previous divestments, enabled special distributions totalling R520 million to shareholders.


Following the classification of enX's Chemicals segment as a disposal group held for sale and a discontinued operation from 30 June 2025,


and the disposal of the Fleet and Lubricants segments in June 2024 and March 2025 respectively, enX's continuing operations comprise the


Power segment and the Service Centre.


The financial results from the continuing operations were negatively impacted by the lower demand in the Power segment with minimal loadshedding


this year compared to approximately 120 days of loadshedding in the prior year, the delay in large-scale power data centre customer projects and


the payment of the non-recurring R15 million limited guarantee claim under the Cap Leverage Proprietary Limited ("CapLev") shareholder indemnity


which became due and payable when the Industrial Development Corporation called on its guarantee.


Revenue from continuing operations decreased 32% to R378 million (2024: R557 million). The Power segment revenues across all revenue streams were


down significantly due to minimal loadshedding, which previously presented significant opportunities in the first half of 2024 together with the


delay in large-scale power data centre customer projects.


Excluding the payment of the non-recurring R15 million limited guarantee claim under the CapLev shareholder indemnity which became due and payable,


Operating loss from continuing operations before net finance costs and impairments, was R23 million (2024: loss of R22 million).


Net financing income was R53 million (2024: R44 million) due to higher surplus cash balances.


Profit before tax from continuing operations was R15 million (2024: R22 million). Headline loss per share from continuing operations was a loss


of 1 cent per share (2024: loss of 8 cents per share).


The net asset value per share was R5.24 per share (31 August 2024: R9.06). The reduction from the prior year is mainly due to cash being returned


to shareholders in the form of special distributions amounting to R1.55 and R1.30 per enX ordinary share paid on 7 April 2025 and 11 August 2025


respectively.


The Group has R8 million (2024: R278 million) of interest-bearing liabilities which includes the disposal group held for sale lease liabilities.


Cash and cash equivalents (excluding the disposal group held for sale) was R175 million (31 August 2024: R772 million), of which R102 million


is cash held at the Service Centre and R73 million is held at New Way Power to meet working capital requirements.


Net cash before financing amounted to an inflow of R241 million (2024: R811 million) including R153 million arising from the disposal of the


Lubricants segment net of amounts paid into an escrow account and cash disposed of as part of the transaction.
