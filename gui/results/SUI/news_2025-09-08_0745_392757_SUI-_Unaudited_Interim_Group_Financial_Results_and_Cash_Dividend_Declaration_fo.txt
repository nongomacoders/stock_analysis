Performance overview


Sun International delivered a solid performance for the six months ended 30 June 2025, navigating macroeconomic headwinds and structural shifts in the


gaming sector. The results underscore the strength of the group's diversified portfolio and its increasing focus on an omnichannel approach. The group's


market-leading assets include land-based casinos, online gaming, resorts and hotels and limited payout machines ("LPM").


The group's continuing income increased by 3.2% to R6.2 billion compared to the six months ended 30 June 2024 ("the prior period"). Excluding the impact


of the Table Bay Hotel ("TBH") lease cessation, group continuing income increased by 6.7%. Group continuing adjusted EBITDA declined by 3.8% to R1.6


billion. Excluding the impact of the TBH lease cessation, group continuing adjusted EBITDA rose by 1.1%. The group's adjusted headline earnings grew by


5.9% to R555 million, translating to adjusted headline earnings of 229 cents per share, a 6.5% increase from the prior period.


The Sunbet group maintained its upward trend, with income increasing by 70.7%, driven by increased volume of activity and deposits. The urban casinos had


a muted performance with income declining by 1.4%. Some operational challenges in combination with a casino market that is under pressure will require us


to re-assess our approach to this portfolio of businesses. Excluding the TBH, resorts and hotels revenue was up 4.3% to R1.3 billion on the prior period,


driven by the recovery of conferencing and events. The Sun Slots strategy bore positive outcomes with income improving by 2.2% to R701 million compared


to the prior period.


The group has consistently demonstrated its capability to generate significant cash flow through its diverse portfolio and is in a strong financial position with


debt (excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities) at R5.0 billion, down from R5.2 billion at 31 December 2024. The debt levels take into account the payment of the


2024 final net dividend of R591 million. Our net interest cost decreased by 15.1% from the prior period as a result of the lower debt and interest rates.


Sun International continues to demonstrate disciplined capital allocation; balancing capital expenditure, shareholder returns and prudent leverage


management. The group maintains a healthy dividend payout ratio while targeting a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio below 2.0x, ensuring financial flexibility


and resilience.


Aligned with its stated dividend guidance of distributing 75% of adjusted headline earnings per share, the board has declared an interim gross cash dividend


of 172 cents per share, amounting to R444 million. This dividend reflects a 6.8% increase over the prior period and underscores the group's commitment to


delivering sustainable value to shareholders.


Outlook


Sun International is a business with a diversified portfolio that has clear and distinct opportunities to drive growth. The group is well-positioned for


sustainable growth, supported by the optimisation of urban casinos, strong momentum in digital conversion for Sunbet, selective expansion in Sun Slots, and


the usual seasonal rebound in resorts and hotels. On an ongoing basis, we will continue to improve the infrastructure and casino offering and seek growth in


selective regulated African markets for Sunbet.


The regulatory environment remains a critical focus area, with Sun International advocating for a balanced framework that aligns the interests of operators,


government, and consumers. Well-calibrated regulation is the most effective safeguard against the proliferation of illegal gambling and is essential to


maintaining a fair and responsible gaming ecosystem.


The group remains open to selective acquisitions in online gaming to enhance scale, geographic diversification and access to technology. We will continue


to find ways in which to optimise and clean-up the portfolio through minority buyouts, where opportune, and redirecting our resources to strategic growth


areas. We remain focused on driving growth in free cash flow while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach is central to


maximising value and aims to achieve the correct balance between returns to shareholders, investment in the business, and value accretive M&A.


Interim ordinary cash dividend declaration (dividend number 56)


Notice is hereby given that the board has declared an interim gross cash dividend of 172 cents (137.60000 cents net of dividend withholding tax) for the

Company at the close of business on the record date appearing below. The dividend has been declared from cash reserves and therefore does not

shareholders who are not exempt.


The issued share capital at the declaration date is 258 181 057 ordinary shares. The salient dates for the interim dividend will be as follows:
