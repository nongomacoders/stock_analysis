Business overview


Motus is a multi-national provider of automotive mobility solutions and vehicle products and services,


delivering over 75 years of steady growth and reliable value creation. Our leading market presence in


South Africa (SA) is enhanced by selected international offerings in the United Kingdom (UK), Australia,


Asia and Southern and East Africa.


Motus employs over 20 000 people globally and is a diversified (non-manufacturing) business in the


automotive sector. Motus is SA's leading automotive group, with unrivalled scale and scope across the


automotive value chain.


Motus offers a differentiated value proposition to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), customers


and business partners with a business model that integrates our four business segments: Import and


Distribution, Retail and Rental, Mobility Solutions and Aftermarket Parts, providing multiple customer


touchpoints that support resilience and meet customers' mobility needs across the vehicle ownership


cycle.


Motus has long-standing importer, distribution and retail partnerships with leading OEMs, representing


some of the world's most recognisable brands. We provide automotive manufacturers with a highly


effective route-to-market and a vital link between the brand and the customer throughout the vehicle's


lifecycle. In addition, we provide accessories and aftermarket automotive parts for out-of-warranty


vehicles and the Mobility Solutions segment sells value-added products and services (VAPS) to


customers, including non-insurance and insurance products, consumer mobility solutions, and fleet


services.


Environment


The global economic environment has become increasingly uncertain over the first half of the 2025


calendar year (CY), with elevated but easing trade tensions (including those relating to US trade tariff


policies), policy uncertainty, and ongoing geopolitical conflicts contributing to a constrained economic


outlook that is dominated by intensifying downside risks and financial market adjustments.


These factors dampened consumers' appetite for high-value purchases, making them highly cost-


conscious when replacing vehicles - carefully considering factors such as new versus pre-owned options,


vehicle category, brand, and timing of replacement. This is evidenced by consumers buying down or


opting to keep their vehicles for longer.


Global growth is projected to be 3,0%1 in CY2025 and expected to increase to 3,1%1 in CY2026, below


the historical (CY00 ? CY19) average of 3,7%1. Global inflation is expected to decline, reaching 4,2%1 in


CY2025 and 3,6%1 in CY2026; however, inflation expectations exceed central bank targets in most


advanced, emerging market and developing economies1.


South Africa


Economic growth in SA remains subdued and economic activity over the first quarter of FY2025 was


weak; however, easing interest rates and inflationary pressures along with improving consumer


sentiment, have resulted in improved economic activity over the remainder of FY2025.


The South African economy is expected to grow by 1,0%1 in CY2025 and further by 1,3%1 in CY2026.


The automotive industry plays an instrumental role in supporting SA's longer-term economic


sustainability, with the industry contributing 5,2% to gross domestic product (GDP) (including 2,0% from


the retail segment and accounting for approximately 23% of the country's manufacturing output)2. The


industry plays an instrumental role in supporting the country's longer-term economic sustainability ?


creating jobs, facilitating trade, and moving people, goods and services in an environment where


alternative forms of transport are scarce and under pressure.


Inflation has declined to 3,0%3 in June 2025, from 5,1%3 in June 2024, with CY2025 inflation projected


to be 3,8%1. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has shifted their target inflation range of 3% to


6% to a preferred rate of 3%4.


According to naamsa2, SA retailed ~549 000 new vehicles for the twelve months to 30 June 2025


(7,2% above the prior period of ~512 000 new vehicles). At June 2025, our retail new vehicle passenger


market share for the 12-months was ~20,1% (2024: ~21,6%). Management's forecast for new vehicle


sales for CY2025 is between 550 000 and 570 000 new vehicles.


The year-on-year increase was driven by growth in the passenger vehicle market stimulated by interest


rate cuts, resilient consumer sentiment, limited selling price increases, value offerings from emerging


brands, and new model launches from established brands (including entry-level models). Increasing


passenger sales volumes demonstrate the continued need for mobility solutions. With affordability


remaining a key concern, customers continue to shift away from luxury vehicles to more affordable


brands, models and vehicle categories as well as pre-owned vehicles.


Affordability constraints also mean that customers are electing to retain vehicles for longer, extending


vehicle replacement cycles and resulting in increased parts and workshop activity, and increased demand


for VAPS.


The SA vehicle rental industry is now stable, with increasing competition on average daily rates, and


opportunities to grow alongside the country's business travel, and domestic and international tourism


sectors. Local demand for flexible transportation solutions (including long-term rentals and subscriptions)


also drives rental market growth and performance.


The aftermarket parts sector is a vital and expanding market, supported by a diverse vehicle parc and


rising vehicle ownership. It includes a range of players from large lutions, and fleet


services.

United Kingdom


The UK economy is expected to grow by 1,2%1 in CY2025 and further by 1,4%1 in CY2026. Key


challenges to growth over the short term include the impact of trade tensions, tighter financial conditions


and elevated uncertainty, including in relation to how global trade tariffs will impact the prices of UK


goods. As of June 2025, inflation had fallen from a peak of 11,1%5 in 2022 to 3,6%5 with CY2025 inflation


projected to be 3,1%1.


The UK new vehicle market grew by 0,4% for the 12-month period to 30 June 2025, with the passenger


market growing by 1,4%6, and the light commercial vehicles (LCVs) and the heavy commercial vehicles


(HCVs) market contracting by 4,3%6 and 8,0%6, respectively. New vehicle sales for the 12-months to


30 June 2025 amounted to ~2,4 million vehicles6, in line with the comparative period.


Passenger and LCV markets have been disrupted by government's new energy vehicle (NEV) targets for


new vehicle sales for OEMs, and declining retail sales are placing dealerships under strain. The historically


robust HCV retail market is beginning to experience reduced demand due to weak business confidence.


Motus' total retail market share decreased marginally over the course of the year.


For HCVs, parts and workshop activity continue to increase due to high levels of demand and regulatory


requirements that mandate regular servicing. For passenger vehicles, longer replacement cycles are


impacting franchise dealership parts and workshop activity as this results in a smaller vehicle parc under


five years old being serviced. These cycles, however, benefit the aftermarket parts sector, which is


substantial and growing; the landscape remains competitive, with a mix of traditional wholesale and


retail businesses, and online distribution channels. The UK's pre-owned vehicle market is undergoing a


transition, with buyers benefiting from increased choice and more competitive pricing.


Australia


The Australian economy experienced modest growth over CY2024, with a moderate improvement


anticipated for CY2025 as inflationary pressures continue to ease. Over the first half of CY2025, increases


in household consumption and private sector wage growth were softer than anticipated and the labour


market was still considered tight. However, as of August 2025, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)


reports higher than expected spending by households and businesses and easing labour market


conditions. With momentum in the domestic economy improving, the risks to the economic outlook and


inflation are currently judged as broadly balanced7. GDP growth of 1,8%1 is expected in CY2025 and


2,2%1 in CY2026. Headline inflation continues to decline to 2,1%8 in June 2025, from 3,8%8 in


June 2024, with CY2025 inflation projected to be 2,5%1.


For CY2024, the Australian automotive market set another all-time record for new vehicle sales at around


1,2 million vehicles9. The Australian new vehicle market decreased by 3,1%9 for the 12-month period to


30 June 2025, with Motus maintaining its retail market share over the year. New vehicle sales for the


12-month period to 30 June 2025 amounted to ~1,2 million vehicles9, compared to ~1,3 million vehicles9


in the comparative period.


Customers are increasingly opting for pre-owned vehicles, and during CY2024, pre-owned vehicle sales


increased by 12% to more than two million units10. Australia's pre-owned vehicle market is experiencing


a period of adjustment, with the market currently favouring buyers, with attractive inventory and


declining prices offering ample opportunities for those looking to purchase.


Motus is exposed to a number of foreign currencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as


where we source our products. There has been currency volatility experienced over a number of years.

Performance


The 2025 financial year was a tale of two halves. The first half was marked by global economic


uncertainty, high interest rates and intensified competition, particularly from the influx of emerging


brands offering affordable vehicles with attractive finishes. This placed pressure on our vehicle sales


volumes and margins, while our non-vehicle businesses were unable to provide sufficient offset.


However, focused management actions in the second half of the year targeting sales, margin recovery,


and operational efficiency drove a significant turnaround, resulting in a far stronger performance that


bolstered our results for the full year.


Motus demonstrated its resilience in the face of weak trading conditions and intensifying competition.


Notably, in FY2025:


-   We achieved 55% non-vehicle contribution to EBITDA, exceeding our strategic target of 50%,


    affirming the strength of our diversified business model.


-   We met our internationalisation target, with 35% of EBITDA generated outside SA, reflecting the


    growing contribution of our operations in the UK, Australia, Asia, and other African markets.


-   Despite new market entrants, Motus maintained its market leadership, selling one in five new


    passenger vehicles in SA.


Our    strategic    focus   on    portfolio   optimisation,   cost   containment,    innovation and


customer-centricity continues to position us for sustainable growth. The Group reduced debt by


R4,2 billion, improved cash flows, and delivered headline earnings per share growth of 5%.


We remain committed to delivering long-term stakeholder value, underpinned by operational agility,


disciplined capital allocation, and a deep understanding of the evolving mobility landscape.


During the year, the Group concluded the disposal of the Mercedes-Benz Truck and Van division (MTV)


in UK Retail, a strategic move to reduce portfolio complexity and sharpen our focus on growing the DAF


business. The transaction generated proceeds of R441 million, which were used mainly to repay debt,


against net assets of R542 million, resulting in a loss of R116 million, including R15 million in incremental


disposal costs.


The SA operations contributed 56% to revenue and 65% to EBITDA for the year


(2024: 54% and 65%, respectively), with the remainder being contributed by the UK, Australia and Asia.


In total the Group's passenger and commercial vehicle businesses, including the UK and Australia, sold


206 010 overall vehicle units (2024: 202 623) comprising 115 910 new units (2024: 115 899) and


90 100 pre-owned units (2024: 86 724) during the year.


Revenue declined slightly by 1%, primarily due to the disposal of MTV. We experienced a R2,9 billion


(3%) reduction in contributions from the Retail and Rental segment - with growth in SA partially offset


by lower contributions from our international operations. This was mitigated by higher contributions from


the remaining segments: Import and Distribution up R2,8 billion (14%), Aftermarket Parts up


R885 million (6%) - with gains in both SA and international operations, and Mobility Solutions up R83


million (3%).


The marginal reduction in revenue of R1,2 billion (1%) was as a result of reduced new vehicle sales of


R3,3 billion (6%) primarily in our international operations, offset by increased contributions from pre-


owned vehicle sales of R1,5 billion (6%), parts and other goods sold of R350 million (1%), rendering of


services of R255 million (2%) and insurance revenue of R11 million (3%).


Operating profit broadly remained in line with prior year, only declining by R27 million to R5 476 million.


The marginally lower operating profit is mainly as a result of margin pressure, strong competition and


reduced demand experienced by our Importer business and the International Retail businesses (the UK


and Australia). The decline was offset by the improved performance of our Vehicle Rental division,


Mobility Solutions, Aftermarket Parts (SA and International) and SA Retail.


Net finance costs decreased by R281 million (13%) to R1,9 billion mainly due to lower average net


working capital and a focused effort to reduce net debt by R3,4 billion for the year, marginally


complemented by reductions in interest rates in the geographies we operate in.


Profit before tax increased by R118 million (4%) to R3 336 million.


A total of 550 cents per ordinary share was declared as a dividend for the year (2024: 520 cents per


share). 240 cents per ordinary share was paid as an interim dividend on 7 April 2025 and a final dividend


of 310 cents per ordinary share will be paid on 6 October 2025.


Net working capital decreased by R959 million (7%) to R12,1 billion.


Equity to net debt structure of 66%:34% (2024: 57%:43%). Core interest-bearing debt decreased by


R3,0 billion (27%) primarily due to the profit generated for the year, proceeds received on the MTV


disposal and the reduction in net working capital. The reduction was offset by the movements in vehicles


for hire, bolt-on acquisitions, capital expenditure and a reduction of the floorplan debt with financial


institutions (replaced with core interest-bearing debt).


Net debt to EBITDA is 1,5 times (2024: 1,9 times) and EBITDA to net interest is 4,2 times


(2024: 3,7 times). Both ratios have been calculated by applying the funders' covenant methodology and


remain well within the debt covenant levels as set by debt funders of below 3,0 times and above


3,0 times, respectively.


Return on invested capital increased marginally to 10,9% (2024: 10,8%). Weighted average cost of


capital decreased to 9,8% (2024: 10,1%) mainly due to the decreased cost of both debt and equity.


Net asset value per share increased by 11% to 11 305 cents per ordinary share (2024: 10 203 cents per


ordinary share).


Cash flows from operating activities amounted to R5,7 billion (2024: R3,5 billion), increasing by 60%.


Liquidity


The liquidity position is healthy with unutilised banking and floorplan facilities of R15,7 billion.


During the year, the Group obtained its maiden credit rating from an independent rating agency,


GCR Ratings:


    -   Credit Rating: Long-Term Issuer AA-(ZA) and Stable outlook


    -   Credit Rating: Short-Term Issuer A1+(ZA)


In November 2024, we converted our international debt funding of GBP 150 million from a Revolving


Credit Facility into a sustainability-linked facility. In May 2025, we refinanced our SA debt by


extinguishing the Rand-denominated ESG banking facilities held and concluding new sustainability-linked


financing agreements with facilities amounting to R7,0 billion.


The sustainability performance targets for both facilities focus on:


-   purchased electricity;


-   own vehicle fuel consumption (in total or target consumption in relation to revenue);


-   diversity and inclusion: female representation occupying all management levels in SA; and


-   community development: number of resource centres established or the number of learners having


    access to resource centres managed by the DP World and Motus Community Trust.


Dividend


A total of 550 cents per ordinary share was declared as a dividend for the year. 240 cents per ordinary


share was paid as an interim dividend on 7 April 2025 and a final dividend of 310 cents per ordinary


share will be paid on 6 October 2025.


Board changes


Motus is led by a diverse board of directors with extensive commercial knowledge, experience, and


expertise. The Board provides ethical and strategic direction to the Group, ensuring that value is created


and protected for stakeholders.


The Board's commitment to and custodianship of good corporate governance ensures that Motus adheres


to the highest standards of accountability, fairness and ethics ? all of which are essential in building and


maintaining credibility, sustainability and trust, and delivering value.


During the reporting period, the following Board and sub-committee changes occurred:


-   Mr. OS Arbee, who reached retirement age, retired as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and from the


    Board and its sub-committees with effect from 31 October 2024.


-   Mr. OJ Janse van Rensburg was appointed as CEO with effect from 1 November 2024 and remains


    an executive director on the Board. On 5 November 2024, he was appointed as a member of the


    Social, Ethics and Sustainability Committee.


-   Ms. B Baijnath was appointed as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) designate with effect from


    1 August 2024, and as CFO and to the Board as an executive director with effect from


    1 November 2024.


Strategy


Our aim is to grow and deepen our participation across all aspects of the automotive value chain, offering


competitive products and services that maximise our share of a customer's vehicle investment and


engender loyalty.


Prospects


The improved momentum from HY2 provides a solid platform for financial year 2026. However, the


outlook remains subject to consumer demand and the challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical


environments in which we operate, which continue to reflect constrained conditions.


Looking ahead to the six-month period ending 31 December 2025:


We anticipate an improved financial performance compared to the six-month period ended


31 December 2024:


   -   Operating profit is expected to grow.


   -   Net finance costs are projected to decline.


   -   Headline earnings per share is expected to increase.


We remain optimistic that our debt covenants will stay within the targeted range of 1,5 times to


1,7 times, supported by strong cash generation and prudent working capital management with vehicles


for hire and inventory expected to be slightly higher due to our up-fleeting cycle to meet seasonal


demand.


Despite these positive indicators, the Group remains exposed to external factors that could impact


performance, including: geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, currency volatility and


non-controllable legislative changes.


Nonetheless, the Group is well-positioned to leverage opportunities and deliver on its strategic priorities.


Appreciation


We would like to thank all employees, customers, suppliers, funders, stakeholders and the Board for


their support during the year.

Performance


The 2025 financial year was a tale of two halves. The first half was marked by global economic


uncertainty, high interest rates and intensified competition, particularly from the influx of emerging


brands offering affordable vehicles with attractive finishes. This placed pressure on our vehicle sales


volumes and margins, while our non-vehicle businesses were unable to provide sufficient offset.


However, focused management actions in the second half of the year targeting sales, margin recovery,


and operational efficiency drove a significant turnaround, resulting in a far stronger performance that


bolstered our results for the full year.


Motus demonstrated its resilience in the face of weak trading conditions and intensifying competition.


Notably, in FY2025:


-   We achieved 55% non-vehicle contribution to EBITDA, exceeding our strategic target of 50%,


    affirming the strength of our diversified business model.


-   We met our internationalisation target, with 35% of EBITDA generated outside SA, reflecting the


    growing contribution of our operations in the UK, Australia, Asia, and other African markets.


-   Despite new market entrants, Motus maintained its market leadership, selling one in five new


    passenger vehicles in SA.


Our    strategic    focus   on    portfolio   optimisation,   cost   containment,    innovation and


customer-centricity continues to position us for sustainable growth. The Group reduced debt by


R4,2 billion, improved cash flows, and delivered headline earnings per share growth of 5%.


We remain committed to delivering long-term stakeholder value, underpinned by operational agility,


disciplined capital allocation, and a deep understanding of the evolving mobility landscape.


During the year, the Group concluded the disposal of the Mercedes-Benz Truck and Van division (MTV)


in UK Retail, a strategic move to reduce portfolio complexity and sharpen our focus on growing the DAF


business. The transaction generated proceeds of R441 million, which were used mainly to repay debt,


against net assets of R542 million, resulting in a loss of R116 million, including R15 million in incremental


disposal costs.


The SA operations contributed 56% to revenue and 65% to EBITDA for the year


(2024: 54% and 65%, respectively), with the remainder being contributed by the UK, Australia and Asia.


In total the Group's passenger and commercial vehicle businesses, including the UK and Australia, sold


206 010 overall vehicle units (2024: 202 623) comprising 115 910 new units (2024: 115 899) and


90 100 pre-owned units (2024: 86 724) during the year.


Revenue declined slightly by 1%, primarily due to the disposal of MTV. We experienced a R2,9 billion


(3%) reduction in contributions from the Retail and Rental segment - with growth in SA partially offset


by lower contributions from our international operations. This was mitigated by higher contributions from


the remaining segments: Import and Distribution up R2,8 billion (14%), Aftermarket Parts up


R885 million (6%) - with gains in both SA and international operations, and Mobility Solutions up R83


million (3%).


The marginal reduction in revenue of R1,2 billion (1%) was as a result of reduced new vehicle sales of


R3,3 billion (6%) primarily in our international operations, offset by increased contributions from pre-


owned vehicle sales of R1,5 billion (6%), parts and other goods sold of R350 million (1%), rendering of


services of R255 million (2%) and insurance revenue of R11 million (3%).


Operating profit broadly remained in line with prior year, only declining by R27 million to R5 476 million.


The marginally lower operating profit is mainly as a result of margin pressure, strong competition and


reduced demand experienced by our Importer business and the International Retail businesses (the UK


and Australia). The decline was offset by the improved performance of our Vehicle Rental division,


Mobility Solutions, Aftermarket Parts (SA and International) and SA Retail.


Net finance costs decreased by R281 million (13%) to R1,9 billion mainly due to lower average net


working capital and a focused effort to reduce net debt by R3,4 billion for the year, marginally


complemented by reductions in interest rates in the geographies we operate in.


Profit before tax increased by R118 million (4%) to R3 336 million.


A total of 550 cents per ordinary share was declared as a dividend for the year (2024: 520 cents per


share). 240 cents per ordinary share was paid as an interim dividend on 7 April 2025 and a final dividend


of 310 cents per ordinary share will be paid on 6 October 2025.


Net working capital decreased by R959 million (7%) to R12,1 billion.


Equity to net debt structure of 66%:34% (2024: 57%:43%). Core interest-bearing debt decreased by


R3,0 billion (27%) primarily due to the profit generated for the year, proceeds received on the MTV


disposal and the reduction in net working capital. The reduction was offset by the movements in vehicles


for hire, bolt-on acquisitions, capital expenditure and a reduction of the floorplan debt with financial


institutions (replaced with core interest-bearing debt).


Net debt to EBITDA is 1,5 times (2024: 1,9 times) and EBITDA to net interest is 4,2 times


(2024: 3,7 times). Both ratios have been calculated by applying the funders' covenant methodology and


remain well within the debt covenant levels as set by debt funders of below 3,0 times and above


3,0 times, respectively.


Return on invested capital increased marginally to 10,9% (2024: 10,8%). Weighted average cost of


capital decreased to 9,8% (2024: 10,1%) mainly due to the decreased cost of both debt and equity.


Net asset value per share increased by 11% to 11 305 cents per ordinary share (2024: 10 203 cents per


ordinary share).


Cash flows from operating activities amounted to R5,7 billion (2024: R3,5 billion), increasing by 60%.


Liquidity


The liquidity position is healthy with unutilised banking and floorplan facilities of R15,7 billion.


During the year, the Group obtained its maiden credit rating from an independent rating agency,


GCR Ratings:


    -   Credit Rating: Long-Term Issuer AA-(ZA) and Stable outlook


    -   Credit Rating: Short-Term Issuer A1+(ZA)


In November 2024, we converted our international debt funding of GBP 150 million from a Revolving


Credit Facility into a sustainability-linked facility. In May 2025, we refinanced our SA debt by


extinguishing the Rand-denominated ESG banking facilities held and concluding new sustainability-linked


financing agreements with facilities amounting to R7,0 billion.


The sustainability performance targets for both facilities focus on:


-   purchased electricity;


-   own vehicle fuel consumption (in total or target consumption in relation to revenue);


-   diversity and inclusion: female representation occupying all management levels in SA; and


-   community development: number of resource centres established or the number of learners having


    access to resource centres managed by the DP World and Motus Community Trust.


Dividend


A total of 550 cents per ordinary share was declared as a dividend for the year. 240 cents per ordinary


share was paid as an interim dividend on 7 April 2025 and a final dividend of 310 cents per ordinary


share will be paid on 6 October 2025.


Board changes


Motus is led by a diverse board of directors with extensive commercial knowledge, experience, and


expertise. The Board provides ethical and strategic direction to the Group, ensuring that value is created


and protected for stakeholders.


The Board's commitment to and custodianship of good corporate governance ensures that Motus adheres


to the highest standards of accountability, fairness and ethics ? all of which are essential in building and


maintaining credibility, sustainability and trust, and delivering value.


During the reporting period, the following Board and sub-committee changes occurred:


-   Mr. OS Arbee, who reached retirement age, retired as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and from the


    Board and its sub-committees with effect from 31 October 2024.


-   Mr. OJ Janse van Rensburg was appointed as CEO with effect from 1 November 2024 and remains


    an executive director on the Board. On 5 November 2024, he was appointed as a member of the


    Social, Ethics and Sustainability Committee.


-   Ms. B Baijnath was appointed as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) designate with effect from


    1 August 2024, and as CFO and to the Board as an executive director with effect from


    1 November 2024.


Strategy


Our aim is to grow and deepen our participation across all aspects of the automotive value chain, offering


competitive products and services that maximise our share of a customer's vehicle investment and


engender loyalty.


Prospects


The improved momentum from HY2 provides a solid platform for financial year 2026. However, the


outlook remains subject to consumer demand and the challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical


environments in which we operate, which continue to reflect constrained conditions.


Looking ahead to the six-month period ending 31 December 2025:


We anticipate an improved financial performance compared to the six-month period ended


31 December 2024:


   -   Operating profit is expected to grow.


   -   Net finance costs are projected to decline.


   -   Headline earnings per share is expected to increase.


We remain optimistic that our debt covenants will stay within the targeted range of 1,5 times to


1,7 times, supported by strong cash generation and prudent working capital management with vehicles


for hire and inventory expected to be slightly higher due to our up-fleeting cycle to meet seasonal


demand.


Despite these positive indicators, the Group remains exposed to external factors that could impact


performance, including: geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, currency volatility and


non-controllable legislative changes.


Nonetheless, the Group is well-positioned to leverage opportunities and deliver on its strategic priorities.


Appreciation


We would like to thank all employees, customers, suppliers, funders, stakeholders and the Board for


their support during the year.
