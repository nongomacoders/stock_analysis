Operating update for the three months ended 30 September 2025


This update serves to inform stakeholders about the Group's operational performance against key measures such as new business volumes and provides guidance


and commentary on key factors influencing the Group's earnings for the three months ended 30 September 2025.


Overview of key metrics


The table below sets out certain key operational metrics for the three months ended 30 September 2025 ("1QF2026" or "the quarter") compared to the three


months ended 30 September 2024 ("1QF2025" or "the prior period"):


Key operational metrics                                      1QF2026     1QF2025    change %


Normalised headline earnings (R million)(1)                    1 759           -           -


Recurring premiums (R million)                                 1 154       1 073          8%


Single premiums (R million)                                   16 490      15 681          5%


Present value of new business premiums (PVNBP, R million)     22 388      20 645          8%


Value of new business (VNB, R million)                           146         197       (26)%


Total direct expenses (R million)                              3 410       3 235          5%


Health members under administration ('000)                     1 350       1 279          6%


(1) NHE for 1QF2025 is not available as the Group did not perform an earnings consolidation for that period, having prioritised the implementation


of IFRS 17.


Momentum Group's disciplined strategy execution continues


The positive earnings trajectory established during F2025 continued into the first quarter of F2026. The Group delivered a strong operational performance


with normalised headline earnings (NHE) of R1 759 million, for the three months ended 30 September 2025. These results were underpinned by effective


strategic execution and continued focus on profitable growth across the Group's business units. The Group's earnings were further supported by positive


market variances (R201 million) for the quarter, although these variances contributed less than in the prior period (R570 million). Short-term insurance


underwriting experience also remained excellent.


The Group's sales, as measured by PVNBP, improved by 8% to R22.4 billion. The Group's VNB declined from R197 million to R146 million, predominantly impacted


by lower life annuity sales in Momentum Investments. This impact was partially mitigated by the VNB improvement in all the other segments, as discussed in


the business unit sections below. Consequently, the Group's new business margin reduced to 0.7% from 1% in the prior period.


Direct expenses increased by 5% across the Group, mainly driven by inflationary adjustments on personnel cost, increased spend to meet requirements


resulting from regulatory changes, and IT investments across the Group. As reported in the F2025 annual results announcement, benefits from the Group-wide


performance optimisation project will become more pronounced toward the latter part of F2026. To date, savings of R389 million have been realised, while a


further R500 million has been identified and is expected to be realised over the remaining strategic period.


The regulatory solvency position of the Group's main insurance entities remains healthy and within their targeted solvency ranges. The solvency cover of


Momentum Metropolitan Life decreased from 1.96 times solvency capital requirement (SCR) (pre-foreseeable dividend) at 30 June 2025 to 1.76 times SCR (pre-


foreseeable dividend) at 30 September 2025. The decrease in solvency cover was driven by dividends paid to the Group (to fund ordinary dividends and the


share buyback programme) and the increase in the SCR following the reduction in nominal yields. The solvency position remains within the target range


of 1.6 to 2.0 times SCR.


As communicated in the F2025 annual results announcement, the operating model review of Momentum Africa has been completed, with changes effective from


1 July 2025. The Namibia short-term insurance business is now reported in Guardrisk, and the health insurance businesses in Lesotho, Botswana, and


Mozambique are reported as part of Momentum Health. As a result, the Momentum Africa business unit comprises the life insurance and asset management


businesses across Namibia, Lesotho, and Botswana, as well as the Namibia health administration business and Ghana up to the date of sale.

Segmental performance


Momentum Retail


Momentum Retail's NHE of R254 million was largely supported by the contractual service margin (CSM) release ("expected profit"), positive mortality


experience in the protection and traditional businesses and a positive contribution from FinGlobal which was acquired during F2025. This was offset by


slightly negative market variances in the protection business following recent shifts in the yield curve.


The CSM for Momentum Retail increased for the quarter aided by new business and positive experience variances.


Momentum Retail's PVNBP improved by 11% to R2.4 billion, supported by a 21% increase in long-term savings new business. The protection business saw a 3%


decline in new business volumes.


VNB improved to R21 million from R12 million in the prior period. This was driven by improved profitability of both the long-term savings and protection


businesses.


Momentum Investments


Momentum Investments achieved NHE of R310 million for the quarter, largely due to the CSM release from the life annuity book, increased contributions from


the wealth management, asset management and multi-management businesses, and the significant reduction in onerous contracts following product design changes


to the back-to-back solution.


The CSM for Momentum Investments grew marginally over the quarter mainly due to new business written.


Momentum Investments' PVNBP increased by 9% to R13.7 billion, primarily aided by higher new business volumes in the Momentum Wealth investment platform.


Life annuity new business volumes were lower than the prior period due to the lower interest rate environment.


VNB declined to R114 million from R198 million in the prior period. Although, VNB for the quarter was largely in line with the run-rate of the last quarter


of F2025. The year-on-year decline was predominantly due to the new business mix being weighted toward lower-margin living annuity products and platform


business. VNB was also adversely impacted by the reprice of the back-to-back annuity product.


Assets under administration increased by 20% year-on-year, owing to pleasing growth in both the local and offshore Momentum Wealth investment platforms


following strong net inflows and favourable market performance. Assets under management improved by 7%, mainly owing to good market growth.


Metropolitan Life


Metropolitan Life's NHE of R248 million was largely aided by the release of the CSM and risk adjustment, positive mortality experience variance on the


funeral book, and improved persistency experience variance in the protection business following continued improvements in observed lapse experience. NHE was


further supported by positive market variances and investment income, although lower than the prior period.


The closing September 2025 CSM and risk adjustment in Metropolitan Life were mainly in line with June 2025.


PVNBP declined by 9% to R1.6 billion, attributable to lower sales volumes across all products. The lower protection and long-term savings new business


volumes were because of a leaner, but more productive, agency force driven by channel optimisation efforts. The reduction in annuity volumes was primarily


due to a shift away from life annuity products driven by lower interest rates and strong competition in the market.


VNB improved to R7 million from R4 million in the prior period, despite lower new business volumes. This result was due to a change in mix away from long-


term savings products, disciplined expense management, better quality of new business (with a reduction in early duration lapses), and distribution cost


efficiencies.


Momentum Corporate


Momentum Corporate's NHE of R427 million was aided by solid profits from the group risk business, and higher earnings from large corporate clients and


FundsAtWork investments business. Earnings were further supported by increased investment income on shareholder assets. Market variances were lower compared


to the prior period.


Momentum Corporate's CSM, which is primarily driven by guaranteed and with-profit annuities business, increased from June 2025.


PVNBP for Momentum Corporate improved by 1% to R3.4 billion compared to the prior period, mainly owing to the onboarding of Woolworths and another large


recurring premium client.


VNB was negative R5 million, an improvement from the negative R10 million in the prior period. This was mainly due to the two large recurring premium deals


in the quarter. New business margins remain under pressure in the current economic environment.


Momentum Health


Momentum Health delivered NHE of R101 million for the quarter. This result was supported by fee income growth of 14% following membership growth across most


schemes, annual administration and managed care fee increases as well as improved performance from capitation contracts. NHE includes R28 million which


represents the earnings from the Africa health entities.


An increase in expenses partially offset the strong fee income growth. This growth was primarily driven by continued investment in strategic growth and


process transformation initiatives while maintaining cost optimisation goals.


Overall membership growth of 6% was achieved, driven by continued strong growth in Health4Me (23%) aided by the onboarding of Woolworths in collaboration


with Momentum Corporate, and growth of public sector membership (3%). Momentum Medical Scheme's membership base increased by 2%, mainly owing to a steady


recovery in membership volumes from retail clients, students and employer groups. The labour segment base increased by 52% mainly due to the amalgamation of


two schemes in the latter part of F2025. Membership in both the open scheme and closed scheme corporate segment remained under pressure, largely because of


lower formal employment levels and affordability.


Guardrisk


Guardrisk reported NHE of R252 million for the quarter. This result was aided by strong underwriting profit growth in Guardrisk General Insurance and


Guardrisk Life, increased management fee income, primarily from the mining rehabilitation guarantee business, and higher investment income.


Earnings for the quarter includes R13 million from the short-term insurance business in Namibia following the Momentum Africa operating model change.


Expenses increased above inflation, largely due to higher personnel costs and IT costs required to support business growth and regulatory compliance.


Momentum Insure


Momentum Insure delivered NHE of R157 million for the quarter driven by strong underwriting performance and an increase in investment income.


The combined ratio improved to 83.1%, well below the long-term targeted range of 92% to 97%. This was supported by a lower claims ratio of 44%, benefiting


from benign weather conditions and continued underwriting and pricing discipline. Expenses remained well controlled, despite investment in underwriting


capabilities, increasing by only 0.2% year-on-year.


Gross written premium (GWP) growth remained under pressure and declined marginally compared to the prior period because of lower than expected new business


volumes. Persistency levels improved slightly and are within management expectations.


Momentum Africa


Momentum Africa achieved NHE of R192 million for the quarter. Earnings were supported by the CSM release in the life business, premium growth and lower


claims ratios in the Namibia and Ghana health businesses as well as positive market variances of R35 million from Namibia and Botswana. NHE was further


boosted by investment income, mainly from bond returns and the capital appreciation on bond assets driven by a reduction in the yield curve in Namibia.


This result was partially dampened by increased new business strain in Lesotho and Botswana, driven by higher expenses. Mortality experience variance was


positive; however, Namibia saw elevated protection claims during the quarter, while Lesotho and Botswana experienced an increase in policy surrenders driven


by economic pressures.


Momentum Group successfully exited the Ghanian market on 9 September 2025 following the conclusion of a transaction that resulted in the sale of its


interest in three entities in Ghana to emPLE Group. Earnings for the quarter includes NHE of R46 million from these entities up to the date of sale.


Africa's PVNBP improved significantly to R1.4 billion. This was largely due to strong growth in corporate new business volumes in Lesotho and Namibia,


higher retail new business volumes in Namibia, and increased annuity new business volumes in Botswana and Lesotho.


VNB saw a pleasing turnaround to R9 million from a loss of R7 million in the prior period. This was primarily driven by an improvement in Namibia's VNB


following strong retail and corporate risk new business growth, and higher corporate risk new business volumes in Lesotho.


India(2)


India recognised an NHE loss of R108 million for the quarter. The earnings loss reported under Indian GAAP of R32 million was an improvement on the


R48 million loss in the prior period. This improvement was aided by strong GWP growth of 24%, with solid contributions from both retail and group business,


and a lower expense ratio of 32% from 40% in the prior period. The earnings loss widened under IFRS 17 due to the net impact of accounting differences,


primarily driven by movements in the loss component, timing differences in premium recognition, reinsurance adjustments, and the capitalisation of


acquisition costs.


Given the compelling market opportunity and the differentiated business model, we remain optimistic about the growth potential of our health insurance


business in India. In line with F2025, the India business expects to break even under Indian GAAP toward the latter part of F2026.


(2) Results for the India investment are reported with a three-month lag. The results are reported on an IFRS 17 basis and include support costs


incurred by Momentum Group outside of the associate. As such, the results may differ from those published by Aditya Birla Health Insurance.


Shareholders segment


The Shareholders segment delivered an NHE loss of R74 million mainly driven by higher audit costs following the implementation of the joint audit, losses on


the incentive share hedge and further write downs of some investments in the venture capital funds, together with related foreign exchange losses.


Outlook


We are encouraged by the excellent earnings performance the Momentum Group achieved over the past quarter, reflecting the resilience of our empowered and


accountable business units. We are firm in our commitment to delivering value for our clients and stakeholders and will maintain our enhanced focus on


driving sales volumes and improving VNB outcomes.


The outlook for South Africa indicates modest growth supported by improved energy availability, easing interest rates and inflation, and the successful exit


from the Financial Action Task Force greylist. While this is encouraging, our operating environment remains challenged by an increasingly competitive


landscape, with subdued economic growth and the elevated cost of living affecting new business growth and margins.


We remain focused on delivering on our Impact strategy, with progress on strategic initiatives gaining momentum. We believe that our financial ambitions


for F2027 (NHE of R7 billion, ROE of 20% and VNB margin of 1% to 2%) are achievable, with the focus being on improving the VNB margin in the near term.
