FINANCIAL OVERVIEW

Profit for the period                 Increase of 33% to R102.4 million


Earnings per share                    Increase of 28% to 20.91 cents per share

Net asset value per share             Increase of 8% to 946.03 cents per share


Balwin's results for the six months ended 31 August 2025 (the period) reflect improved


macroeconomic conditions. Whilst global trade risks and weak GDP growth prevail, the


moderation of inflationary pressures and a cautious easing of interest rates of 50 basis points


over the period by the Reserve Bank have positively supported consumer demand, enhanced


loan affordability, and stimulated increased investment in fixed property.


The market improvement has created a more supportive environment for residential property


development. During the period, the group maintained its focus on the construction and timely


handover of quality apartments and ensuring that development activity is prudently aligned


with sales trends.


Group revenue totalled R1.2 billion (August 2024: R852.7 million), an increase of 44% from the


prior interim period, reflecting the improved conditions in the residential housing market. Group


revenue growth was driven by a 51% increase in apartments sales to R1.1 billion, owing to a


45% rise in apartment handovers with 928 apartments recognised in revenue


(August 2024: 640) and supported by sales price growth achieved in the period.


Balwin Annuity delivered another pleasing performance, with revenue up 55% to R101.5 million


(August 2024: R65.7 million), continuing the growth trajectory and increasing its contribution to


group revenue to 8.3% (August 2024: 7.7%)


The group reported a slight decline in gross margin to 29% (August 2024: 32%), primarily due to


the absence of land sales in the current period, compared to profits recognised from land


disposals in the prior period. The gross margin from apartment sales remained steady at 23%


(August 2024: 23%), underpinned by strong profitability in Balwin Annuity. Tight cost control


contributed to a 35% increase in group operating profit.


The group closed the period with a healthy cash position of R303.4 million (February 2025:


R254.8 million) and continues to closely monitor, manage and plan cash flows into the


foreseeable future. Debt levels and bank covenants at period-end were within the required


thresholds. The group's loan-to-value ratio reduced to 39.3% (February 2025: 40.4%).


DIVIDEND


Following a careful review of interim trading conditions, the board has resolved not to declare


a dividend for the 2026 interim period (August 2025: no interim dividend declared). In the


current environment, the board's priority remains the prudent allocation of capital towards


reducing the group's debt exposure.


The board will reassess the potential declaration of a dividend at the conclusion of the 2026


financial year.
