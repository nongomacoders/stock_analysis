**Earnings per share and Headline Earnings per share have been adjusted for the after-tax dilutive effect of the future


  conversion of the accelerated empowerment (AE) shares to ordinary shares held by the minority shareholders in Maskew


  Miller Learning Proprietary Limited, which will result in increased earnings attributable to non-controlling interest. During the


  interim period, diluted earnings per share have been limited to basic earnings per share as the assumed conversion of


  potential ordinary shares would be anti-dilutive.


PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW


The financial results for the six months ended 30 September 2025 ("period") is down compared to the prior


period, largely due to the lower profitability of the Education segment following delayed procurement from the


provincial departments. This decline was partially offset by the improved profitability in the Print segment and


the first-time inclusion within the period of Novus Media Proprietary Limited ("Novus Media"), Novus Sport


Proprietary Limited ("Novus Sport") and On the Dot Supply Chain Management Proprietary Limited ("On the


Dot"), reported within the Print, Publishing and Distribution segment of the Group. During the prior year, the


results included profits from derivative instruments held in Mustek Limited ("Mustek") amounting to R59,7


million, within the Packaging Segment, compared to equity accounted earnings of R8.6 million in Mustek being


recognised during this period.


Group revenue increased by R21 million (1,0%) from R2 088 million to R2 109 million. The Education and


Packaging segments decreased by 64,9% and 6,2% respectively, while the Print Segment increased by 0,5%.


The Education Segment experienced delayed orders during this reporting period due to the delay in the


Department of Basic Education ("DBE") finalising the Foundation Phase Catalogue, lateness of the 2025/2026


National Budget finalisation and overall financial constraints experienced by the provincial education


departments. The Publishing and Distribution segment contributed 16,3% to total Group revenue during the


period.


Operating profit* decreased to R102,5 million (2024: R196,4 million) and gross profit margin increased to


31,2% (2024: 30,2%), mainly driven by improved margins in the Print segment.


Operating expenses increased since the prior year due to the first-time inclusion of the Publishing and


Distribution segment, most significantly staff cost of R84 million and technology cost of R14 million. The


Education segment's investment in technology of R14,3 million and the Group's acquisition-related cost of


R9,8m resulted in the total overhead costs increasing from R435 million to R556 million for the Group.


Retrenchment costs of R3,9 million were recognised during the period (2024: Rnil).


Print, Publishing & Distribution


Revenue increased by 23,2% to R1 640 million (2024: R1 331 million) and operating profit* increased to


R153,2 million (2024: R86,3 million). Revenue increased mainly due to the Publishing & Distribution segment's


first-time inclusion during this period. The revenue recognition of the DBE contract in the Print segment is


higher than the prior year, with more than half of the contract recognised at 30 September 2025. The Print


segment's overall revenue however remained almost flat with a 0,5% increase from the prior period, due to


increased recognition of the DBE contract and increased Magazine sales with a tonnage increase of 38,1%,


which was offset by reduced print revenue from Newspapers. Newspapers saw a tonnage drop of 44,5%, with


overall sales tonnages decreasing with 8,9% for the Print segment.


Improved margins due to price increases and recovering paper prices led to improved profitability in the Print


segment. This resulted in an overall increased gross margin from 23,1% in the prior period to 31,2% in the


current period for the Print, Publishing and Distribution segment.


Education


Revenue decreased by 64,9% to R156,9 million (2024: R447,2 million) due to delayed orders from the


provincial departments, resulting in an operating loss* of R81,6 million (2024: R75,1 million operating profit).


This includes R14,3 million (2024: R15,8 million) investment in technology and R64,3 million (2024: R64,3


million) amortisation on acquired intangible assets.


Packaging


Revenue decreased by 6,2% to R345,4 million (2024: R368,0 million). ITB experienced lower revenue


compared to the prior year, with general market pressures which have contributed to this decline.


Gross margin is in line with the prior year of 18,2% with the segment achieving an operating profit* of R32,0


million (2024: R35,7 million), representing a decrease of 10,4%.


CASH GENERATION


The Group closed the period with a cash balance of R741,7 million, a decrease of R70,4 million for the six


months. The first half of the financial year typically sees the Group invest substantially in working capital to


fund seasonal demand and to deliver on the DBE contract.


The cash balance includes an amount of R309,4 million being tied up for the mandatory offer made to Mustek


shareholders to enable the Group to fulfill its cash consideration of the offer.


The Group was in a net cash position of R205,9 million (2024: R172 million net debt) as at 30 September 2025.


Capital and interest repayments on the outstanding loan balance in the period amounted to R102,3 million with


an external dividend of R174,1 million paid to Company's shareholders during the period.


Capital expenditure amounted to R41,3 million with spend directed towards expansion projects of current plant


and equipment of R11,5 million and R14,8 million for maintenance in the Print segment.


Acquisition of additional shares in Mustek amounted to R26,8 million cash outflow.


ACQUISITIONS


During the six months period, the Group acquired an additional 2,8 million shares in Mustek Limited


increasing its shareholding from 35,07% to 39,95% as at 30 September 2025.


Following the Mustek mandatory offer and the offer circular which was circulated to Mustek shareholders on


30 May 2025, the Take Over Regulation Panel ("TRP") investigation remains ongoing, which results in a


certificate of compliance not being able to be issued. In the absence of obtaining a certificate of compliance


from the TRP, the Group cannot implement or give effect to the mandatory offer. Notwithstanding the


regulatory delays, the Group is committed to the mandatory offer to the shareholders of Mustek and looks


forward to the conclusion of the regulatory process.


OUTLOOK


The decline in print volumes and anticipated paper price increases places pressure on future margins which


the Group needs to manage on an ongoing basor the Group.

OUTLOOK


The decline in print volumes and anticipated paper price increases places pressure on future margins which


the Group needs to manage on an ongoing basis. Revenue growth in the Print, Publishing and Distribution


segment requires investment in the development and support of products that meet our customers' advertising


and promotion needs. Clients are moving to digital advertising and communicating the cost effectiveness of


print is a priority if we want to arrest the decline in print advertising spend. We remain confident that print


advertising is valuable and effective, but digital data and integration is required as part of our offering.


Maskew Miller Learning ("MML") received confirmation from the DBE that the Foundation Phase catalogue is


anticipated to be released in the 2025 calendar year with procurement taking place in the 2026 year. The


extent of future orders for the current curriculum catalogue remains uncertain and there is no indication when


the next phase of the curriculum update will be announced. While additional orders are expected from


provincial education departments, aggregated annual orders are expected to be lower than the prior year due


to budget constraints.


MML continues to work closely with the Group's AI associate, Bytefuse, to develop our AI supported education


tutor.


Novus Holdings is proud to have achieved a B-BBEE Level One Contributor status for the second year and


will continue with initiatives to transform and further enhance its status.
