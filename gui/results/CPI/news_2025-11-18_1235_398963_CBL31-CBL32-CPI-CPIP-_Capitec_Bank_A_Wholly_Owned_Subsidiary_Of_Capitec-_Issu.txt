CAPITEC BANK (A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CAPITEC:


ISSUER CREDIT RATINGS RAISED AND POSITIVE OUTLOOK AFFIRMED


On 14 November 2025 S&P Global Ratings ("S&P") raised their


foreign currency and local currency long-term ratings on South


Africa to "BB" and "BB+" from "BB-" and "BB", respectively and


affirmed the positive outlook for the country.


At the same time, S&P raised their long-term global scale


ratings for Capitec Bank to "BB" from "BB-" and affirmed their


"B" short-term global scale rating. The rating agency also


raised their long-term South Africa national scale rating for


Capitec Bank to "zaAAA" from "zzAA" and affirmed their


"zaA-1+" short-term national scale rating for the Bank. S&P


affirmed their positive outlook for Capitec Bank.


S&P advised that their rating action on South Africa was based


on the improvement in South Africa's growth and fiscal


trajectory, their forecast of slightly higher GDP growth of


1.5% on average over 2026 to 2028, expected good credit growth


through 2026, credit losses having moved closer to normalised


levels and expected healthy performance by South African


banks.


Capitec Bank's credit ratings are limited by the sovereign


rating as S&P does not rate South African financial


institutions above the country's foreign currency sovereign


rating. This is due to the direct and indirect impact that


sovereign distress could have on domestic banks' operations.


S&P advised that Capitec Bank's ratings could move in tandem


with the sovereign's ratings if action is taken on the


sovereign in the next 12 months.
