COMMENTARY


Although Mantengu listed in August 2022, Mantengu had to complete a rights issue (December


2022) and share consolidation (31 March 2023) to correct the legacy issues created because of the


reverse takeover. This meant that Mantengu could only actively trade from 1 April 2023 onwards,


meaning that the company is effectively 2.5 years old and at the very beginning of its investment


journey. The Group has undergone a massive growth phase which has underpinned the significant


growth in the Group's balance sheet, specifically net asset value. Mantengu has made the


following investments over the last 12 months:


?   August 2024:           Meerust Chrome (Pty) Ltd (100% owned)


?   December 2024:         Sublime Technologies (Pty) Ltd (100% owned)


?   February 2025:         Iron Production Plant (100% owned)


?   August 2025:           Blue Ridge Platinum (70% owned)


The Group's primary focus is on expediting the develop and build phases of all the investments as


it continues to ramp up each operating asset to steady state.


The results for the period under review were impacted by a number of factors as detailed below.


The significant flooding experienced early in calendar 2025 had a negative impact on revenue and


net profit before tax of an estimated R51 million and R40 million respectively because of lower


production volumes in our chrome operations. Staff costs and machinery costs remained fixed


during this period of lower production. The one positive aspect to arise out of this flooding was that


we have collected and stored enormous volumes of water such that our chrome operations have


not had to use municipal water for the half year, a notable outcome considering that chrome


beneficiation is a water intensive process.


In addition, Langpan's contracted off taker, RWE Supply and Trading GMBH, exercised an outright


purchase option to buy chrome concentrate at a lower price compared to that of the market


during the quarter May 2025 to July 2025. This resulted in a negative impact on both revenue and


net profit of R29 million. The perfect storm of market conditions prevailed to give rise to this option


in chrome prices decreasing and increasing drastically within a very short period. This is not


expected to recur in future.


Blue Ridge Platinum was consolidated into the group from 1 August 2025 following the receipt of


the Section 11 ministerial approval. The inclusion of Blue Ridge resulted in a negative impact of R8


million on net profit with R3 million relating to operating costs for the month of August 2025 and R5


million relating to consolidation entries because of Blue Ridge being accounted for as an asset


acquisition as opposed to a business combination. The group will continue to incur R3 million of


operating costs monthly until Blue Ridge commences production which is expected to be in the first


half of calendar 2026. Notably, the Company has secured an offtake agreement for the supply of


chrome concentrate with Monteagle International (UK) Limited at a minimum of 300 000 dry metric


tonnes at a rate of 10 000 dry metric tonnes per month. The product will be a 40% - 42% chrome


concentrate and will be sold on a CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) basis using the published market


price by FerroAlloyNet.com. Blue Ridge Platinum expects that deliveries will commence during the


first half of calendar 2026, after an approximate 4 month capex build of a new chrome plant.


Infrastructure expenditure that was not capitalised but expensed had a negative impact on net


profit of R16 million. This expenditure related to future proofing both chrome operations from any


potential future flooding. The expenditure related to trenching, piping, damming, removal and


rebuilding of access roads and berm building. The objective of this was to channel water to areas


that do not prevent access to mining pits in future as well as increased water storage in the event


of heavy downpours.


OUTLOOK FOR FY 2026


Langpan has returned to a steady state of production post the flooding. Furthermore, the


commissioning process of Langpan's second chrome wash plant has started with hot


commissioning expected to be achieved at the same time that these results are released. This will


significantly bolster Langpan's production of chrome concentrate. The Board looks forward to


updating shareholders via SENS on the commissioning of the plant in the coming days. The group is


proud of this significant milestone in that this was fully funded from operating cash flows.


Meerust's production continues to increase, and the group is busy executing the introduction of a


second chrome wash plant on site to bolster production.


The design of Blue Ridge's chrome wash plant has been completed, and the group will now begin


to order long lead items. Blue Ridge is expected to be in full production in the first half of calendar


2026.


The Board's focus is to ramp up all operations to steady state in the shortest time frames such that it


can reduce expansionary capex requirements and start delivering a return to shareholders.
