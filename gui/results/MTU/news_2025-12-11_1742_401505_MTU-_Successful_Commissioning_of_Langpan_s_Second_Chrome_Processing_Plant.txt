SUCCESSFUL COMMISSIONING OF LANGPAN'S SECOND CHROME PROCESSING PLANT


In terms of paragraph 3.4(b) of the Listings Requirements of the JSE Limited, the Board of Directors


of Mantengu ("the Board") is pleased to announce the successful commissioning on 10 December


2025, of the Langpan Mining Co Proprietary Limited's ("Langpan") state of the art Chrome


Processing Plant ("Chrome Plant"), being its second processing plant.


The Langpan Chrome Plant is a 50 tonne per hour plant that will require approximately 31,500


tonnes of chrome ore feedstock to produce chrome concentrate. Langpan has tailings on site,


surveyed at around 300 000 tonnes, carried at cost as work-in progress in inventory, that will be fed


into the new Chrome Plant. This estimated 300 000 tonnes will provide Langpan with approximately


10 months of feed based on the 31,500 throughput above, without any cash mining cost. This will


ramp up the mining operation in order to sustain two chrome plants, which require approximately


60,000 tonnes of monthly chrome ore feed. The test work was completed on the tailings and


Chrome Plant by Gravitas Innovations Proprietary Limited ("Gravitas Minerals"),


Given the successful commissioning of the Chrome Plant, Langpan will now commence test work


on the Platinum Group Metals ("PGM") contained in the tailings. It is noted that PGM feedstock has


not yet been valued and is not recorded as inventory on the balance sheet at present. The Board


will inform the market in due course about its future PGM investment strategy.
