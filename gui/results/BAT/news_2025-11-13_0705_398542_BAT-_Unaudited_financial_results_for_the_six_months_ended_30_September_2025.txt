UNAUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025


The Board of Directors ("Board") hereby reports to Brait's shareholders ("Shareholders") on the unaudited


results for the six months ended 30 September 2025.


FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS


? Virgin Active:


  o Membership growth increased marginally across key territories despite club refurbishment closures


    and higher terminations in some territories.


  o All territories saw strong revenue growth year on year: UK (12%), South Africa (15%), Italy (7%) and


    APAC (13%).


  o Significant increase in capital expenditure (from £58m in 2024 to £96m in 2025) due to the


    refurbishment program and new club development.


  o LTM EBITDA to 30 September 2025 grew 45% to £112m.


? Premier:


  o The business continued its strong operational performance, with revenue and EBITDA growth of 6%


    and 14% year on year, respectively.


  o Performance was driven by strong growth across all divisions, with MillBake being the core driver.


  o Premier recently announced a transformational merger with RFG, which will significantly diversify its


    product mix.


  o Strong cash generation has allowed the business to de-gear significantly, which has provided scope


    for the company's recently announced interim cash dividend and share repurchase program.


? New Look:


   o Reasonable performance in the first quarter, despite the continued tough operating environment in


     UK fashion retail.


   o Revenue for the first six months was down 2% on the prior year, whilst the restructure of the


     business post the injection of new money has resulted in EBITDA increasing by 34% to £21m.


   o Advisor appointed to help in the assessment of strategic options for the business.


? Brait:


   o Strategy remains to unlock value and optimise the asset base to return capital to shareholders


   o In April 2025, the Company repurchased £10 million of its Convertible Bonds at a discount to their par


     value. Following these repurchases, £133.6 million of the Convertible Bonds remain outstanding.


   o Available cash and facilities amounted to R0.7 billion at the reporting date.


   o As an investment holding company, Brait's key reporting metric of NAV per share is R3.21, a 5%


     increase compared to the R3.06 reported for FY25. From an IFRS perspective, earnings and headline


     earnings per share is 12 cents (HY25: 39 cents).


HIGHLIGHTS FOR BRAIT'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO


Virgin Active (59% of Brait's total assets):


? The leading international premium health club operator, Virgin Active's strong revenue growth and


  operational turnaround has continued across all territories.


? Territory update to 30 September 2025:


  o Southern Africa (35% of group revenue):


    - Strong sales, particularly in higher end clubs driven by sales momentum post refurbishments.


    - Churn remains elevated due to club closures for refurbishment and affordability issues, which


      management is addressing through the loyalty programme and data analytics.


    - The focus remains on estate upgrades, with a significant increase in capital expenditure to


      enhance member engagement and experience to support yield increases.


    - 631k active members as at September 2025.


  o Italy (27% of group revenue):


    - Higher churn as a result of yield increases impacting more price sensitive regions.


    - Significant growth opportunity in the Italian market with new sites identified and leases signed for


      2026/7.


    - 192k active members as at September 2025.


  o UK (24% of group revenue):


    - Above budget sales increase driven by the club refurbishment program.


    - Significant capex still required to elevate the remaining estate to drive retention and support yield


      growth.


    - Proactive strategy to "roll" clients onto 12-month contracts was successfully implemented but has


      led to elevated churn in the short-term.


    - 140k active members as at September 2025.


  o Asia Pacific (14% of group revenue):


    - Strong sales across Singapore and Thailand offset by below budget sales in Australia and


      elevated churn partly because of the yield management strategy.


    - Focus remains on operational improvements, price optimisation and improving service levels.


    - 60k active members as at September 2025.


? Valuation as at 30 September 2025 (performed on a pre-IFRS16 basis):

    - EBITDA increased by 12.4% to R1.3 billion, mainly due to focus on site efficiencies.

    R119 million.
