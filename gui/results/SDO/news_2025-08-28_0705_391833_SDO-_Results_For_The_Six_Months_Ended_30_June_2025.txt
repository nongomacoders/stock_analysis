COMMENTARY


The STADIO Holdings' board of directors ("Board") takes pleasure in reporting another solid set of


results for the six months ended 30 June 2025, showcasing strong financial performance and robust


cash generation, positioning itself well for the opening of the new comprehensive STADIO


Durbanville campus in early 2026.


The STADIO Group grew revenue by 16% from R826 million to R957 million, driven by a 9% growth


in student numbers with a notable increase of 14% in new students.


Furthermore, core headline earnings grew by 28% from R137 million to R176 million.


Looking forward, we are on track to reach our pre-listing forecast of 56 000 students by the end of


2026 and believe we can reach 80 000 students by 2030.


The Board has adopted a policy of declaring and paying dividends on an annual basis based on


excess free-cash flow available, after considering the capital needs for future growth projects. No


interim dividend has therefore been declared (June 2024: nil).
