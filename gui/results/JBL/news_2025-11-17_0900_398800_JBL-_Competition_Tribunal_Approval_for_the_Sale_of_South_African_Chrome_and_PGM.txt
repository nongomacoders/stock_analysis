Competition Tribunal Approval for the Sale of South African Chrome and PGM Operations


Jubilee, the Zambia copper focused producer, is pleased to announce that South African Competition


Tribunal (SACT) has issued the Company with a merger clearance certificate, and as such, has


unconditionally approved the sale of the South African Chrome and PGM Operations to One Chrome


(Pty) Ltd (One Chrome) under the Competition Act (Disposal). SACT approval was a suspensive


condition to the Disposal as outlined in the Circular to shareholders. (see announcement dated 12


August 2025).


Approval of the South African Reserve Bank is still required, and the Company does not envision this


being reasonably withheld.


The last material condition precedent is audit related. This workstream is well underway and is expected


to be completed by 30 November 2025. Following completion of the Disposal, which is expected by the


end of CY2025, the Company will be focused solely on its Zambian copper projects whilst retaining its


investment in the Tjate platinum project in South Africa.


If all of the suspensive conditions of the Disposal are not satisfied or waived by 31 December 2025 then


the sale agreement for the Disposal may be terminated by either Jubilee or One Chrome.
