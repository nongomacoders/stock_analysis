Operational Update South Africa


Q4 FY2025


Jubilee, a diversified metals producer with operations in South Africa and Zambia, today publishes its


South Africa operational and project update for the fourth quarter ended 30 June 2025 (Q4 FY2025),


reflecting a strong production performance for the financial year to June 2025. An update on the


Zambia Operations is expected to be released in August 2025.


Highlights


-   South Africa reported Lost Time Frequency Injury Rate of 1.33 (Q4 FY2024: 1.62) with no classified


    injuries reported.


-   Chrome concentrate production for Q4 FY2025 up 19.9% from the comparative quarter in the


    previous financial year to 505 578t (Q4 FY2024: 421 698t).


-   Production for the year ended 30 June 2025 reached 1 932 798t, up 24.8% from the comparative


    year (FY 2024: 1 548 205t), and exceeding revised guidance of 1 850 000t.


-   6E Platinum Group Metals* (PGM) production for Q4 FY2025 reached 8 973 oz, up 14.6% from the


    comparative quarter a year earlier (Q4 FY2024: 7 828 oz).


-   PGM production for the year ended 30 June 2025 reached 38 579 oz, up 6.0% from 36 411 oz for


    the comparative year ended 30 June 2024, in line with revised guidance of 38 000 oz.


-   Cessation of OBB chrome ore supply contract at end-June 2025 (equivalent to 450 000tpa of


    chrome) to be offset largely by increased production from Thutse operations.


* 6E PGM - Platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and gold


South Africa production guidance for FY2026


-   Chrome concentrate Production guidance of 1.65 - 1.80Mt


-   PGM Production guidance of 36 000 - 40 000 oz


Statement from Leon Coetzer, Jubilee CEO:


"Our South African operations have produced strong production results for the period which speaks to


our deep understanding in manging the interdependency of our chrome and PGM operations backed


by the dedication of our team.


Over the past quarter we have seen large fluctuations in the price of chrome. The Company's revenue


and earnings exposure to chrome prices have significantly increased in line with the increase in


operational output with a 1% movement in chrome price now being equivalent to an approximate 4.5%


movement in the platinum price. Since May 2025, the chrome price has depreciated by approximately


11.4% which has been largely buffered by platinum prices that have appreciated by nearly 33% over


the same period and further supported by the significant increase in chrome production.


As announced at the beginning of June 2025, we are finalising the sale agreements relating to the


proposed sale of the South African chrome and PGM operations, and we remain committed to ensuring


excellent operational safety and production."

Operational Summary for Q4 FY2025


Jubilee's South African operations depend on chrome ore being delivered to the Company's processing


facilities, from which chrome concentrate is first extracted. The tailings resulting from this processing


of chrome ore contain commercially extractable quantities of PGMs. In essence, this makes Jubilee


first and foremost, a chrome concentrate producer, with the benefit of PGM production as a follow-


on product. The Company has seen a sharp increase in chrome production from third party chrome


ore partnership agreements.


The cessation of the ore supply and operating contract to the OBB chrome ROM facility in South Africa


at the end of June 2025, has been largely offset by a sharp increase in chrome production from third


party chrome ore partnership agreements. These partnership agreements offering direct exposure to


chrome prices, now contribute approximately 70% of current chrome production.


With the significant growth in the Company's chrome processing operations, the exposure to chrome


markets outweighs the exposure to PGM markets in a ratio of approximate 4.5-to-1. This ratio suggests


that a 1% downward movement in the chrome price will require an increase of 4.5% in the platinum


prices to offset the reduced chrome earnings. Equally, a recovery in chrome prices will have a far


greater impact on the Company's earnings. Chrome markets have retracted over the past 3 months by


approximately 11.4%, driven mainly by concerns on world demand for stainless steel which is often a


lead indicator of global growth expectations. The 33% appreciation in the platinum price has been able


to buffer largely the expected loss in chrome earnings.


The increased production rates at the Thutse operations will offset largely the discontinued tolling


agreement which accounted for an approximate 450 000 tonnes of chrome production during the


FY2025 period. Production levels are expected to remain at approximately 1.65Mt on an annualised


run rate.


The discontinuation of the OBB operating contract will have a limited impact on the PGM production


profile of Jubilee given the adequate availability of PGM bearing feedstock.


Jubilee holds a second tolling agreement with this specific ore feed supplier, producing 600 000tpa of


chrome concentrate, which reaches maturity in February 2027.


The new PGM joint partnership announced on 9 April 2025 under an earnings share agreement has


commenced with operational trials which is ongoing under the supervision of the Jubilee technical


team. The team is working towards enhancing the partnered processing facility to improve the final


product specifications.
