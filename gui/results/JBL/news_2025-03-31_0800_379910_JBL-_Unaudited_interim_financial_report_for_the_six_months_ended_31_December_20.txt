Unaudited interim financial report for the six months ended 31 December 2024


Jubilee, a diversified metals processor in Africa, with copper operations in Zambia and also


chrome and PGM operations in South Africa, is pleased to announce its unaudited interim


financial report for the six months ended 31 December 2024 (H1 FY2025).


Highlights


Safety


-        Zambia reported a Lost Time Frequency Injury Rate (LTFIR) of 0.65 (H1 FY2024: 0.61).


-        South Africa reported a LTFIR rate of 1.45, an improvement from 2.41 for H1 FY2024.


Financial


Group


-      Group revenue up 51.0% to US$141.5 million (H1 FY2024: US$93.7 million) driven


       mainly by increased production of chrome concentrates during the period.


-      Group EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) down


       6.8% to US$13.6million (H1 FY2024: US$14.6 million) impacted by softer chrome prices


       during the period.


-      Invested US$17.8 million (H1 FY2024: US$16.8 million) in the expansion of its copper


       and chrome operations.


-      Cash of US$8.4 million at the end of the period (30 June 2024: US$19.3 million).


Zambia


-      Copper revenue up 5.1% to US$8.3 million (H1 FY2025 US$7.9 million).


-      Copper cost per tonne increased by 30.6% to US$5 948/t (H1 FY2024: US$4 554/t),


       due mainly to a once off contractual adjustment of US$573/t (accounting for 12.6%


       of the increase) to the price of copper ore purchased during the period and the


       impact of plant stoppages due to power constraints.


-      Copper gross profit down 88.0% to US$0.3 million (down 53.6% excluding the once off


       contractual adjustment) (H1 FY2024: US$2.5 million) driven mainly by the


       commissioning of Roan operations and subsequent stoppage due to power


       interruptions.


-      Copper gross profit margin of 3.9% (14.0% excluding the once off contractual


       adjustment) (H1 FY2024: 31.7%).


South Africa


-      Chrome revenue increased by 75.9% to US$114.5 million (H1 FY2024: US$65.1 million)


       supported by increased production from the two new chrome processing modules.


-      Revenue per tonne of chrome concentrate increased by 23.3% to US$111/t (H1


       FY2024: US$90/t) supported by the sale of chrome concentrate at prices above


       historically fixed margin chrome contracts.


-      Average cost per tonne of chrome concentrate inclusive of purchase of ROM increased


       by 30.3% to US$99/t (H1 FY2024: US$76/t), which is in-line with the Company's


       strategy to increase the proportion of third party run-of-mine material (ROM)


       purchases to the historically fixed margin chrome contracts.


-      Chrome gross profit increased by 31.1% to US$13.1 million (H1 FY2024: US$10.0


       million) supported by a higher contribution from chrome sales realised from third


       party ROM purchases.


-      PGM revenue decreased by 9.2% to US$18.8 million (H1 FY2024: US$20.7 million),


       predominantly due to a decrease in PGM ounces produced of 8.9% to US$18 435oz


-      (H1 FY2024: 20 244oz), due mainly to a shifted priority towards chrome recoverability


       during the first quarter to capitalise on favourable chrome market conditions resulting


       in lower PGM feed grades.


-      PGM cost per ounce decreased by 20.1% to US$616/oz (H1 FY2024: US$771/oz)


       mainly as a result of the reallocation of operating cost to the chrome operations.


-      PGM gross profit increased by 45.1% to US$7.4 million (H1 FY2024: US$5.1 million).


Market


-      The average LME copper price was flat at US$9 193/t for the period under review (Q1


       FY2025: US$9 200/t).


-      Average CIF chrome price per tonne declined from US$309/t during Q1 FY2025 to US$252/t


       in Q2 FY2025. Pricing reached the US$200/t CIF level towards the end of Q2 FY2025.


-      The average PGM basket price remained flat at US$1 360/oz for the period under review.


Operational


Zambia


-      Copper units produced down 13.6% to 1 454t (H1 FY2024: 1 683t) due mainly to the


       impact of power outages experienced during Q2 FY2025.


-      Copper units sold increased by 13.0% to 1 336t (H1 FY2024: 1 182t) supported by sale


       of product held in stock.


-      ROM and in process stock increased sharply, reaching approximately 1.21Mt


       containing an estimated 8 466t of copper units for future processing at Munkoyo.


-      Roan upgrade and commissioning completed reaching ramp-up throughput targets of


       a combined 45 000tpm (with a combined feed of historical waste and tailings) during


       the period before experiencing shut-downs to protect the integrity of equipment due to


       power constraints.


-      Copper ROM production at Munkoyo was unaffected by power constraints:


          o Munkoyo is on track to achieving its targeted production of 70 000tpm of low-


            grade ROM for future processing; and


          o High grade ROM at a rate of 8 000tpm, delivered to Sable for refining.


-      Project G is continuing with resource definition work to complete the design of its


       Open- Pit expansion.


South Africa


-       The new chrome processing modules built at Thutse, with a production capacity of


        50ktpm of chrome concentrate were completed and commissioned during Q2 FY2025.


        The modules met the design throughput during December 2024, contributing to a


        record quarterly chrome concentrate production for Q2 FY2025 of 519 278t**.


-       Chrome concentrate produced reached record half year high increasing by 35.7% to


        974 659t** (H1 FY2024: 718 189t), well on track to meet and exceed full year guidance


        of 1.65Mt.


-       6E PGM* production, on track to meet full year guidance of 36 000oz, at 18 435oz in


        the first half (H1 FY2024: 20 244oz).


* 6E PGM ? Platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and gold


** Inclusive of 100% of production declared from operations in partnership with the resource


owners


Post the period under review


Zambia


-        On 21 January 2025, Jubilee executed an additional power agreement with a new broad


         based power provider to supplement the existing power supply agreement, aimed


         specifically at achieving steady power supply at Roan.


-        On 14 February 2025, Jubilee announced that Roan commenced with the processing of new


         high-grade copper feed material. The material is in line with Management's expectations


         with current feed assays exceeding 1.6% copper (Cu), which is approximately double the


         grade of material processed previously at Roan. Roan will gradually increase the proportion


         of high-grade copper feed to the historical tailings in the feed to ensure circuit stability over


         a four to six week period.


-        In support of this switch over, the Company secured the rights to an initial 200 000t of high-


         grade copper feed material and the option to increase the allocation of such material, with


         the potential of securing a long-term continuous feed supply.


Production Guidance


-        Copper: Production guidance remains under review until results from the initial


         operational run following the completed switch over to the high-grade ore at Roan has


         been confirmed for a sustained minimum period of six weeks. This strategy to migrate to


         higher grade copper feedstocks at Roan is expected through time to lead to increased


         copper production following the initial assessment of the optimal processing recipe. Early


         results are encouraging. Management is looking to ensure that the new production levels


         are sustainable to provide informed guidance. An update is targeted for release at the


         end of April 2025.


-        Chrome and PGM: Well on track to achieve chrome concentrate production of 1.65Mt


         and PGM production guidance of 36 000oz for FY2025. An operational update is targeted


         for release by mid-April 2025.


Statement from Leon Coetzer, Chief Executive Officer:


"The first half of the 2025 financial year was one of both success and challenges. While we were able


to deliver our Roan expansion project in Zambia and begin the parallel processing of waste and run-


of-mine material, severe power disruptions on the grid at the end of the period, meant this start-up


was short lived.


The ability of Jubilee to react to this challenge is a testimony to the resilience of the team to execute,


post period end, an additional power agreement with a new broad based power provider to


supplement the existing power supply agreement as a more permanent solution. In addition, Jubilee


secured an initial 200 000t of high-grade copper feed material for processing together with an option


to increase the allocation of such material, with the potential of securing a long-term continuous feed


supply.


We have since commenced with the processing of the new high-grade copper feed material at our


Roan Concentrator. We will initially run a blend of high-grade copper and historical tailings gradually


migrating to a dedicated high-grade copper feed as we ensure the integrity of the processing recipe.


We target to reach this point by end of April 2025. Early results are very encouraging as we push to


complete this switchover of the plant.


I am particularly excited by the continued development and expansion of our Munkoyo Open-Pit mine


which offers the potential to significantly boost copper output at our Sable Refinery.


At our South African operations, the new chrome processing modules at Thutse were completed and


commissioned during the period and reached design targets during December 2024. This increased


chrome production operated in partnership with the resource owner was the main driver behind record


half-year production and the 51% increase in group revenue compared with the first half of the


previous year.


While commodity prices were subdued over the period especially in both chrome and PGM we have


seen a strong recovery in the chrome price post period end while copper prices continue to receive


strong support. This positions Jubilee well to benefit from its exposure to both copper and chrome


during the current period."
