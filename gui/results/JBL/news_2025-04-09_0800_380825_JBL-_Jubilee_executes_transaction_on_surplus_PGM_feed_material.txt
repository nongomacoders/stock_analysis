Jubilee executes transaction on surplus PGM feed material


Jubilee, a diversified metals processor in Africa, with copper operations in Zambia and chrome


and PGM operations in South Africa, is pleased to announce a joint partnership agreement


for its surplus PGM feed stock (Agreement) at its operations in South Africa.


The Company initiated the process to find a partner following the surplus surface stock of


PGM bearing material created as a by-product on the back of a sharp increase in chrome


production.


In the six months to December 2024, Jubilee's chrome concentrate production reached a


record half year high, increasing by 35.7% to 974 659t (H1 FY2024: 718 189t), and is well on


track to meet and exceed full year guidance of 1.65Mt.


Highlights


   -   Jubilee agrees a joint partnership with an existing PGM producer to process part of


       the Company's surplus PGM & chrome stock.


   -   The surplus surface stock of PGM bearing material is driven by the sharp increase in


       chrome production at Jubilee's operations reaching a record 974 659t for the six


       months ending 31 December 2024 (H1 FY2025).


   -   Under the Agreement Jubilee is looking to commence deliveries at 18 000tpm of


       chrome and PGM bearing material, with the potential to increase deliveries to


       30 000tpm.


   -   The increased PGM processing capacity equates to an estimated 11 500 PGM ounces


       per annum assuming a feed rate of 30 000tpm, which is in addition to the Company's


       existing PGM processing capacity.


   -   Under the terms of the Agreement, earnings generated from the project are shared


       equally.


   -   Jubilee has agreed to an initial Agreement term of 12 months, which the parties may


       extend into a long-term agreement.


Statement from Leon Coetzer, Chief Executive Officer:


"In the first half of our current financial year, construction and commissioning of the two new


chrome processing modules at Thutse was completed and commissioned successfully. This


contributed to Jubilee's chrome operations producing in excess of a record 950 000t of


chrome concentrate over the 6 months ending December 2024.


These expanded chrome operations have contributed to an increasing PGM surface stock


produced as a by-product from the chrome operations. Our preference, as we have indicated


before, is to partner with existing PGM producers to process this excess stock rather than


investing further capital to expand our own PGM capacity.


The Agreement we have now secured is with an operation well known to the Jubilee team


and we will work closely with them to optimise their operations to maximise the financial


return.


This transaction offers us the opportunity to immediately commence with the processing of


our excess PGM material and has the effect of increasing our production capacity by as much


as 32% (at a 100% level) with no additional capital, when compared with our guidance for


FY2025."


The Agreement


Jubilee's PGM feed stock has increased significantly on the back of the expansion of its


chrome operations. The PGM containing material is produced as a by-product from the


chrome operations following the recovery of chrome. Jubilee's Inyoni PGM operations are


operating at full capacity and as previously announced, the Company has looked to form


partnerships with existing PGM producers to utilise available processing capacities.


Jubilee has entered into a joint partnership agreement with a South African PGM producer.


Under the terms of the Agreement Jubilee will deliver chrome and PGM feed material to the


existing chrome and PGM processing facility. Jubilee is appointed to oversee the operational


and technical performance of the processing facility and will sell the processed PGM ounces


on behalf of the partnership under an equal earnings share arrangement.


The Company is looking to commence with monthly deliveries of chrome and PGM feed


material of 18 000tpm with the ability to increase deliveries to 30 000tpm based on the


technical performance of the operations.
