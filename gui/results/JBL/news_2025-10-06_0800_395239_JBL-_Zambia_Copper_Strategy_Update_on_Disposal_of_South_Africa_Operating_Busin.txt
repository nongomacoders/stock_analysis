on of the mining operations. This is likely to cost around


    US$9 million and can be implemented in phases. These phases can be streamlined if necessary.


    The Board of Directors is likely to review the proposed plans for this capital expenditure during


    early Q2 FY2026. If approved an announcement on timings and costings will be made shortly


    thereafter.


    The Company is in advanced discussions to establish a joint venture partnership to conduct


    exploration, resource review and development of its various mining assets. Such a partnership


    agreement will allow Jubilee to focus on its core processing capabilities while its partner


    accelerates the implementation of the mining solution and expanded exploration program.


    There are a number of other licence areas which Jubilee has been able to secure. These are all


    within the larger Molefe district. The total area of the licences exceeds 16 000 hectares compared


    to the current near 400 hectares held by Molefe Mine. The resource review and exploration JV


    partner is likely to replicate the Molefe Mine JV into other mining licence areas after due diligence


    has been concluded.


    Resource drilling by the preferred JV partner at Project G is expected to commence during Q2


    FY2026 to afford Jubilee sufficient time to complete the Molefe Mine pit expansion and drilling,


    with an internal target of 31 October 2025 by which to agree heads of terms on a JV mining partner.


    The project benefits from existing infrastructure and potential for collaboration on a central


    processing unit due to its proximity to other mining operations.


?   Pillar 3 ? Processing of Jubilee acquired surface stockpiles and tailings dumps: Large


    Waste Project


    Jubilee secured the rights to the Large Waste Project through a purchase agreement totalling $18


    million, of which approximately 50% of the total acquisition value has been settled to date with the


    balance payable over approximately 12 months. The approximate 240 million tonnes of surface


    material was formed by historical mining activity discarding the overburden rock. Jubilee has been


    developing separation techniques to pre-classify the surface material to produce a copper


    containing stream with a copper grade similar to the grade that is traditionally mined as copper reef


    in the area.


    The scale of the Large Waste Project offers the opportunity to implement multiple processing


    modules. These modular processing units have adopted techniques similar to the development of


    Jubilee's modular chrome units in South Africa. It is estimated that one unit is capable of producing


    an estimated 2 250tpa of copper units.


    The Company is seeking a partner to contribute towards the funding and implementation of the


    project to accelerate the roll-out of the processing footprint under a non-dilutive partnership


    agreement. At present there have been many approaches from the copper industry as well as from


    financial investors who wish to partner with Jubilee. This would be non-dilutive for shareholders.


    The various production routes are being modelled and analysed by Management. These are being


    debated with the potential JV partners. The internal target date for selecting the JV partner is 31


    December 2025.


    Mufulira Slag Project


    The Company was awarded the tender to process these slag waste dumps. This was subject to


    agreeing commercial terms with the owner of these waste dumps. At the Mufulira Slag project the


    majority shareholding of the owner has recently changed hands, and it is suspected to be the reason


    for the delay in any meaningful engagement. Jubilee continues to push for constructive


    engagement in the matter.


    The project offers far reaching benefits to the wider community and it is hoped that progress will be


    forthcoming in the near future.
