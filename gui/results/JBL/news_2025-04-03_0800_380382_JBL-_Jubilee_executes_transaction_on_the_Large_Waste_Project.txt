Jubilee executes transaction on the Large Waste Project


Jubilee, a diversified metals processor in Africa, with copper operations in Zambia and chrome and


PGM operations in South Africa, is pleased to announce an update on the Large Waste Project


transaction.


Jubilee has secured the exclusive rights to the Large Waste Project (Project) for a reduced consideration


of US$18 million (previously US$30 million). The Company has until mid-May 2025 to elect to acquire


the assets and settle the approximately US$11.5 million dollars remaining of the consideration over a


period of 12 months. Jubilee has been performing a due diligence on the Project which included


sampling campaigns, laboratory test work and pilot scale trials, the results of which will inform the


board's decision as to whether to exercise the option to acquire the assets.


On the back of encouraging results from the due diligence completed so far, Jubilee has entered into


an agreement to sell 10 million tonnes of the estimated 260 million tonnes of material to a selected


multi-national metals company. The value of the 10 million tonnes material trade is estimated at


US$6.75 million. Under this agreement Jubilee will gain a detailed insight into the performance of the


material when processed at the partnered company's existing facilities. The results of which will


provide a high degree of confidence in the expected performance of the material if processed in future


by Jubilee.


Statement from Leon Coetzer, Chief Executive Officer:


"Jubilee's copper strategy continues to gain further momentum on the back of the restart of its Roan


Concentrator processing high-grade copper material as well as the expansion of its Munkoyo mining


operation. The Large Waste Project offers tremendous potential for Jubilee to significantly expand its


copper portfolio in Zambia. We have been considering carefully the optimal partner for the


implementation of the Project especially following the encouraging results of the due diligence review.


Jubilee has held extensive engagements with numerous interested parties on the best way to monetise


the project. The project has attracted keen interest from both metal offtake backed funding as well as


large multi-national copper producing entities interested to partner on the potential project.


The trade of this small quantity of material compared with the size of the asset (less than 5% of the


estimated contained material) not only demonstrates the potential value of the asset but also offers


Jubilee the opportunity to confirm the technical performance of the material through a large-scale


trial."
