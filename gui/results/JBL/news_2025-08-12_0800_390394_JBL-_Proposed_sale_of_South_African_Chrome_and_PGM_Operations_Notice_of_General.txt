8.   Illustration of the impact of the Disposal on the Group's financial position


The financial information below is unaudited and provides an illustration of the net assets of the Group on the


basis set out in the notes to show the effect of the Transaction as if it had occurred on 31 December 2024.


This information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and, by its nature, addresses a hypothetical


situation and does not, therefore, represent the Group's actual financial position or results. Such information


may not, therefore, give a true picture of the Group's financial position or results nor is it indicative of the results


that may or may not be expected to be achieved in the future.


The illustrative statement of financial position is based on the unaudited statement of financial position of the


Group as at 31 December 2024 and of the Disposal Group at the same date. No adjustments have been made to


take account of trading, expenditure or other movements subsequent to 31 December 2024, being the date of


the last published historical financial information of the Group. Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information does


not constitute financial statements within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act.
