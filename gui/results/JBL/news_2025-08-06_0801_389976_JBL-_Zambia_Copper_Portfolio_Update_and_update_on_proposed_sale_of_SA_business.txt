results


        are being reviewed by a competent person and the results will be released in due course.


    ?   Early indication from the drilling campaign suggests the potential to combine pits 2 to 4 into a


        single large open pit to offer increased mining flexibility and increased throughput to sustain the


        targeted high-grade ROM of between 6 500 to 8 500tpm at 2.5% Cu.


    ?   The new pit designs factored in the drilling results of the copper sulphide ore body discovery


        below the near surface copper oxide layer currently being targeted.


    ?   Discussions are in progress with an established mining and exploration partner to implement


        the further expanded Munkoyo and develop Project G while undertaking an exploration program


        of the newly secured exploration properties within the area.


    ?   Copper production for H1 FY2025 was severely impacted by the power and infrastructure


        challenges, previously reported. Roan was placed under care and maintenance for an extended


        period while power security was resolved and process upgrades successfully completed to


        allow for the simultaneous processing of high-grade copper materials and tailings.


    ?   On the back of a successful Roan restart, copper units production for H2 FY2025 reached 757


        tonnes (H1 FY2025: 1 454 tonnes) (Guidance for H1 FY2026 of 2 300 tonnes) with annual


        production for FY2025 reaching 2 211 tonnes (Guidance for FY2026 of 5 100 tonnes)


Zambia production guidance for FY2026


   ?   Copper unit production guidance for H1 FY2026 of 2 300 tonnes and 5 100 for the full year


       FY2026.


   ?   Further capital dependent projects which are currently underway and being targeted to


        commence within FY2026, offer the potential to increase annual copper production by


      approximately 10 000 tonnes as follows:


                 o Onsite Munkoyo processing unit - 1 440 tonnes per annum;


                 o Project G processing unit - 1 320 tonnes per annum;


                 o Refining at Roan - 2 544 tonnes per annum; and


                 o Two processing modules at the Large Waste Tailings dump - 5 500 tonnes per


                   annum.


Statement from Leon Coetzer, Chief Executive Officer:


"I am pleased to report significant progress across our Zambia portfolio which has in place all the assets


we need to maintain the momentum on our copper expansion strategy. By dedicating our existing


processing capacity at Roan to a combination of third-party sourced higher-grade mined material and


process tailings while advancing our Munkoyo and Project G mining operations to feed an expanded


Sable, we are building a robust and stable copper production profile. In addition, we are expanding our


copper exploration footprint and advancing our Large Waste project.


The energy related challenges we faced earlier this year, though difficult, have helped us emerge with


a clearer, more focused strategy backed by secure power supply and higher value material supply


agreements. This operational focus, prioritising run-of-mine and previously mined materials, closely


resembles the successful evolution of our South African chrome and PGM operations albeit with an


integrated portfolio of our own feedstock supply.


We are excited to leverage our unique capabilities in processing transitional copper reefs, available in


vast quantities, and look forward to delivering clear guidance on our production under new supply


agreements in the coming months. This also fits into our thinking of seeking a mining joint venture


partner at our mineral assets to ensure management's focus can remain on processing. Our


commitment remains to scale operations in a non-dilutive, capital-efficient, and sustainable manner as


we advance toward our medium-term targets."

Zambia projects update


Integrated mine-to-metals business: Sable Refinery together with nearby Munkoyo and Project G


Sable is undergoing an expansion to, at completion, offer an annual processing capacity of


approximately 14 000 tonnes of copper units. This expansion is targeted for completion in Q1 CY2026.


The expansion will accommodate increased production from the nearby Munkoyo, Project G, and other


near-surface third-party opportunities in the area, as well as copper oxide concentrate from Roan. The


Company estimates approximately US$5.5 million of capital investment required for the expansion at


Sable.


Munkoyo to date was operating a single pit with a mining rate of 80 000tpm. Of this, approximately


3 500tpm of high-grade ROM (of approximate 2.5% Cu) is delivered to Sable. A resource drilling


program has commenced to upgrade resource confidence and optimise open-pit design. Munkoyo


consists of 9 initial test open pits of which only pit 5 was developed to mine and deliver the initial copper


ore to Sable. Eight drill holes have been completed of varying depths to test lithology and continuity.


Early indication from drilling results has pleasingly delineated the presence of copper sulphide beneath


the existing oxide material.


The Company is exploring the potential to merge the satellite pits into one large open pit which will


provide increased flexibility and productivity for supplying Sable. The Company has temporarily halted


mining at Munkoyo for July and August 2025 while the extended pit design is completed based on the


drilling results and will recommence ore delivery to Sable from September 2025 in addition to the current


production from Roan.


Production will commence targeting 4 500tpm ramping up to 8 500tpm. At the targeted grade this


equates to approximately 200tpm of copper units delivered to Sable in addition to the production from


Roan.


An on-site processing plant is being planned at Munkoyo. Discussions are in progress with an


established mining and exploration partner to implement the further expansion at Munkoyo. This plant


will be designed for the low-grade ROM that incorporates a copper leaching, solid liquid separation, and


copper precipitation circuit. The implementation of the first copper processing unit at Munkoyo is


targeted for commissioning by the end of Q2 CY2026 and offers an increase in copper units by a further


120tpm to reach 320tpm (3 840 tonnes per annum).


Resource drilling at Project G will commence during Q2 FY2025 to afford the time to complete the


Munkoyo pit expansion and drilling. The project benefits from existing infrastructure and potential for


collaboration on a central processing unit due to its proximity to other mining operations.


The Company is in advanced discussions to establish a joint venture operating partner to conduct


exploration, development and mining of its various mineral assets. Such a partnership agreement will


allow Jubilee to focus on its core processing capabilities while its partner accelerates the


implementation of the mining solution and expanded exploration program.


Processing of third-party copper feedstock: Roan Concentrator: Cash-generating treatment


hub


Roan is an independent, cash-generating processing facility that produces both copper oxide and


copper sulphide concentrate from waste, tailings, and previously mined material. The copper sulphide


concentrate is sold via off-take agreements and the copper oxide concentrate is delivered to Sable for


the production of copper cathode. The Company is underway with a study to install a US$2.5 million


copper refining stage at Roan to offer greater flexibility and further enhance margins. The refining step


will also seek to recover the copper lost in the super fine fraction.


Following the upgrade of Roan and successful trials earlier in the year, the Company has secured a


feedstock supply agreement with a nearby third-party operation, targeting a minimum grade of 1.4%


Cu.


The main focus at Roan has been to restart operations following the shut down during Q1 of CY2025


due to the previously announced infrastructure challenges. Trials and tests to reconfigure and upgrade


the plant to enable it to treat high grade ore and tailings is fully completed with Roan meeting its


operational targets for July 2025 and well on track to exceed its targeted 350 tonnes of copper units for


August 2025.


Large Waste Tailings dump portfolio


In recent years, Jubilee has secured rights to vast quantities of surface tailings and low grade mined


rock dumps in Zambia. Through its research and testing, Jubilee has characterised these resources


and grouped them into immediate and longer-term potential (+5 years from production) and ranked the


opportunities. All longer-term and low-ranking resources have been classed as non-core and a sale


process has been initiated. In total the Company has concluded transactions of approximately US$18


million worth of non-core surface assets since the start of the year, with discussions underway for further


disposals of non-core surface tailings assets.


The Company has prioritised the Large Waste project (in excess of 240 million tonnes). Jubilee is


looking to roll out a series of 25 000tpm modular processing units on-site, based on the design


implemented at Roan. One unit is capable of producing 2 250tpa of copper units. The Company is


seeking a partner to contribute US$25 million towards the funding and implementation of the project to


accelerate the roll-out of the processing footprint under a non-dilutive partnership agreement. Jubilee


is well advanced in negotiations to replace the initially targeted partnership pursued with an Abu Dhabi


based group.


The project will ultimately include a dedicated upgrading, copper recovery and refining solution due the


vast resource able to carry the investment requirement over time. The initial modular units will produce


a saleable upgraded copper product which offers the potential that the project self-funds the investment


requirements over time through early revenues generated from the sale of this material. The Company


successfully executed an initial trade of the material earlier in the year demonstrating the inherent value


of this exciting project.


Combined these well-defined projects offer the potential to advance Jubilee copper portfolio in Zambia.


Update on the Proposed Disposal


The Company also informs Shareholders that, following announcements on 6 June and 10 July 2025,


the Definitive Agreements for the disposal of its Chrome and PGM Operations in South Africa are in


near final form. A circular containing full details of the Proposed Disposal, including a notice of general


meeting will be posted to Shareholders in the week commencing 11 August 2025.
