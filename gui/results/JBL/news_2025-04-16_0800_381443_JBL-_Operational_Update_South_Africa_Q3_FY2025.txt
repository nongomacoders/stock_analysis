Statement from Leon Coetzer, Jubilee CEO:


"I am pleased with the solid set of production numbers that our well embedded South African


operations have produced for both the March 2025 quarter and also the first nine months of the


financial year to 30 June 2025.


The successful implementation of the Thutse project in partnership with the resource owner has


increased the original chrome concentrate guidance by 12% to 1.85 million tonnes for the FY2025


period. Our Inyoni PGM plant continues to operate at full capacity and improved input PGM grades


together with the recently announced joint partnership agreement to process excess PGM feed stock,


have increased the original guidance by just under 6% to 38 000 PGM oz.


The PGM joint partnership agreement, which targets the processing of the increasing PGM feed stocks


due to our expanding chrome operations, affords us the opportunity to expand our PGM production


capacity by an approximate 30% without the need of spending any capital."
