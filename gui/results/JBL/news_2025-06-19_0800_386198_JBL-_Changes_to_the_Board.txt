Changes to the Board


Jubilee, a diversified metals producer with operations in South Africa and Zambia, announces that Ms


Tracey Kerr, independent non-executive director of the Company, will be retiring from her position on


the Jubilee Board effective 30 June 2025.


Ms Kerr was recently appointed senior independent director for Hochschild Mining plc. This new


responsibility will require increased attention from Ms Kerr, and as such she will be stepping down


from her role at Jubilee.


Dr Mathews Phosa, Chairperson of the Jubilee Board, commented:


"I would like to thank Tracey for her invaluable contribution to the Company and more specifically her


leadership as Chairperson of the Sustainability Committee of the board. I wish Tracey every success in


her new role and future endeavours."
