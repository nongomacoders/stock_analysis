Operational Update South Africa


Q1 FY2026


Jubilee, the Zambia copper focused producer, today publishes an operational and project update for


its South African operations for the first quarter ended 30 September 2025 (Q1 FY2026).


Workstreams to conclude the sale of the Company's South African Chrome and PGM Operations


(Disposal Group) are progressing well. Approval by the South African Competition Commission and


delivery of the audited accounts for the Disposal Group for the year ending 30 June 2025, are the two


remaining significant conditions precedent to the sale. The Company is hopeful that completion of the


sale will be achieved by the end of CY2025. The Company expects to deliver its audited results for the


financial year ending 30 June 2025 during the second half of November 2025.


Highlights


-   Shareholder approval received on 28 August 2025 for the disposal of Jubilee's Chrome and PGM


    Operations with the first US$15 million of the sale consideration received in cash


-   South Africa reported a Lost Time Frequency Injury Rate of 0.96 representing a 27.8% decrease


    compared to the last quarter, (Q4 FY2024: 1.33) with one classified injury reported


-   Chrome concentrate production for Q1 FY2026 was down 11.2% from the comparative quarter in


    the previous financial year to 404 151t (Q1 FY2025: 455 381t) due mainly to the cessation of the


    OBB chrome ore supply contract (OBB contract) at the end of Q4 FY2025 (equivalent to


    approximately 450 000tpa of chrome) to be offset largely by increased production from Thutse


    operations


-   PGM* production for Q1 FY2026 reached 8 382 oz, down 10.1% from the comparative quarter in


    the previous financial year (Q1 FY2025: 9 328 oz) due mainly to the impact of the cessation of the


    OBB contract on PGM feed supply


* 6E PGM - Platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and gold


Statement from Leon Coetzer, Jubilee CEO:


"Our South African operations have delivered a solid performance whilst the sale of our South African


chrome and PGM Operations is progressing to expectation. To this end, we are pleased to see a notable


decrease in the LTIFR.


The sale of our South African Chrome and PGM Operations has only two remaining significant


conditions to be fulfilled, being approval from the South African Competition Commission and delivery


of the audited accounts of the Disposal Group for the year ending 30 June 2025. Additionally, the period


saw us receive the first tranche of the sale consideration of US$15 million. We are hoping to receive


approval for the completion of the sale by the end of this calendar year and we look forward to


updating our shareholders accordingly."


South Africa production guidance for FY2026

Operational Summary for Q1 FY2026


On 21 July 2025 the Company announced that its contract supplying material to the OBB facility was


not renewed (OBB contract). The OBB contract contributed the equivalent of 450 000tpa of chrome


concentrate (based on FY2025). The impact of the cessation of the OBB contract has been largely offset


by a sharp increase in chrome production from third party chrome ore partnership agreements as well


as increased production at the Company's Thutse operations. The partnership agreements, offering


direct exposure to chrome prices, contribute to approximately 64.1% of current chrome production.


PGM tailings from the OBB processing facility continue to be processed at the Inyoni PGM facility. The


discontinuation of the OBB contract had a limited impact on the PGM production profile of Jubilee


with the operational handover completed. PGM feed supply to the Inyoni PGM facility stems


predominantly from the tailings generated from the OBB facility, supplemented by PGM tailings from


the Windsor operations as well as the existing PGM bearing feedstock in the historical chrome and


PGM tailings at Inyoni.


Jubilee holds a second tolling agreement with this specific ore feed supplier, producing in excess of


500 000tpa of chrome concentrate at its Windsor operations, which reaches maturity in February


2027.


The new PGM joint partnership under an earnings share agreement has completed a two month


operational trial at the facility. The Jubilee technical team is making further modifications currently to


the processing facility to improve the final product specifications. The upgraded facility is expected to


commence production during Q3 FY2026.
