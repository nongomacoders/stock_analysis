Molefe Mine Co-operation and Development Agreement


Jubilee, the Zambia copper focused producer, is pleased to announce the execution of a co-operation


and project development agreement (Agreement) with Galileo Resources Plc (Galileo), for the


implementation of an accelerated resource exploration program and the development of Jubilee's


Molefe Mine in Zambia (Project).


The Agreement combines Jubilee's established in-country operational and processing expertise with


the exploration and geological expertise of Galileo. This combined expertise enables the dedicated


focus by the responsible teams on each of the critical project workstreams namely, the continued


management of the mining operations, the focused implementation of an on-site processing solution,


and the resource definition drilling and exploration program, both for the Molefe Mine and potential


targeted neighbouring areas, which have been secured by Jubilee.


The Agreement offers Galileo the right to earn up to a 23.75% interest in the Molefe Mine holding


company, with Jubilee retaining a 71.25% interest and the remaining 5% being held by a local Zambian


firm, through the funding of an exploration and resource development program of Molefe Mine.


Jubilee's current capital investment into Molefe Mine is secured through a preferential earnings right


until its investment has been recovered fully from Molefe Mine's future earnings.


Highlights


    ?   Molefe Mine is placed on an accelerated development path with the formation of dedicated


        highly skilled teams to focus on:


            o    Day-to-day operational management of the Project currently ramping up production


                 to achieve 4 500tpm of high-grade run-of-mine (ROM) (+2% copper (Cu) refined at


                 Sable) and the on-site stockpiling of the low-grade ore (approximately 0.7% Cu)


                 already reaching 2.2Mt on surface since the end of October 2025


            o    Completion of the design and implementation of the on-site processing facility to


                 process the mined ore and stockpiled on-site lower grade ore


            o    Upscaling of the mine plan and resource definition through exploration drilling of


                 Molefe Mine


    ?   Jubilee retains control of the Molefe Mine (71.25% holding) ensuring it remains a core,


        strategic asset to Jubilee


    ?   Jubilee's existing investment into the Project is secured through a preferential earnings right


        from the Project until fully recovered


    ?   Galileo to fund US$700 000 towards the exploration and development of the resource


        definition for the Project expected to confirm the early resource potential recognised by


        Jubilee


    ?   The Agreement offers the potential for exploration and development to be expanded into


        further properties to replicate the success of the Molefe Mine


    ?   Galileo has a highly experienced resource development team that includes veterans from


        major mining houses with specific experience in Zambia and Southern Africa, offering in-house


        developed intellectual property that will focus on the Project


    ?   Molefe Mine has already been established as an operating mine with high-grade ore already


        being refined at Sable, providing a head start into the understanding of the underlying geology


        of the Project


    ?   While this transaction initially covers only the Molefe Mine licence area, the greater Molefe


        area includes highly prospective contiguous exploration properties secured by Jubilee. These


        may be covered by further future agreements.


    ?   This joint project approach, which brings together skills not readily available to an individual


        company, offers the potential to rapidly scale the operations into a large scale mine with an


        integrated processing facility, serving as an example for future similar projects which may be


        replicated across Zambia


Leon Coetzer, CEO of Jubilee, commented:


"We are delighted to have found a partner with such an established track record in Zambia for the co-


development of Molefe. The combined skill set of the two teams is seldom available to a single mining


project of this size.


The joint agreement enables Jubilee to dedicate its focus on the day-to-day operations and the


development of the processing solution for the Molefe Mine. Outsourcing the mine planning and


resource measurement to Galileo, which has an exceptional team with decades of experience and a


wealth of in-country and African knowledge, was a natural and pragmatic option.


The Jubilee operational team is looking forward to working with the Galileo operational team to


accelerate the development of the Molefe Mine project.


The joint shareholding in Molefe Mine ensures a common purpose to develop this opportunity and


offer shareholder returns ? potentially one of the most significant, major copper deposits in the Central


province of Zambia."


Key Terms of the Agreement


Galileo holds the right to earn-in up to a 23.75% interest in the Molefe Mine holding company through


the funding of a resource definition and exploration program for a minimum investment of


US$700,000. Galileo must complete the agreed scope of work within eight months of the date of the


Agreement to acquire the Sale Shares from Jubilee. Jubilee retains a 71.25% interest on completion of


Galileo's earn-in with the remaining 5% held by a local Zambian firm.


Executive committees will be formed to oversee the Project. For the joint executive committee Jubilee


will nominate two members, one of whom will be the chairperson, and Galileo will nominate one


member. The executive committee shall continue to operate until Galileo has fully acquired the Sale


Shares. Upon the issue of the Sale Shares, Jubilee shall nominate two directors to the board of the


Molefe Mine holding company and Galileo shall nominate one director.


Jubilee's current investment into the Molefe Mine will be classed into an interest-bearing capital loan


and non-interest-bearing shareholder loan. The capital loan will hold a preferential earnings allocation


until fully settled before the distribution of any earnings in accordance with the terms of the


Agreement.


Background on Molefe Mine


Molefe Mine to date was operating as a single pit with a mining rate of 80 000tpm. Of this,


approximately 3 500tpm of high-grade ROM (of approximately 2% to 2.5% Cu) is delivered to Sable. A


resource drilling program has commenced to upgrade resource confidence and optimise open-pit


design. Molefe Mine consists of nine initial test open pits of which only Pit 5 was developed to mine


and deliver the initial copper ore to Sable. Early indication from drilling results have positively


delineated the presence of copper sulphide beneath the existing oxide material.


The Company is exploring the potential to merge the satellite pits into one large open-pit which will


provide increased flexibility and productivity for supplying Sable. The Company temporarily halted


mining at Molefe Mine for July and August 2025 while the extended pit design was completed. Ore


delivery to Sable recommenced during September 2025 which is in addition to the current production


from Roan.


Production commenced at 3 500tpm ramping up to 4 500tpm within 45 days and the Company is


targeting to reach 8 500tpm   While this transaction initially covers only the Molefe Mine licence area, the greater Molefe


        area includes highly prospective contiguous exploration properties secured by Jubilee. These


        may be covered by further future agreements.

200tpm of copper units delivered to Sable in addition to the production from Roan.


An on-site processing plant is being planned at Molefe Mine. This plant will be designed for the low-


grade ROM that incorporates a copper leaching, solid liquid separation, and copper precipitation


circuit. To date approximately 2.2Mt of lower grade material has already been stockpiled at Molefe


Mine in anticipation of the processing units.
