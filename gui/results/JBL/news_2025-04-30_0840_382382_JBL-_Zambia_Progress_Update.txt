Zambia Progress Update


Jubilee, a diversified metals producer with operations in South Africa and Zambia, announces it is at the


advanced stages on concluding the trials of the processing of various high grade copper ores, as


announced on 6 February 2025, at its Roan Concentrator (Roan). The results from these trials will be used


to select material for a targeted long-term supply agreement. The finalisation of the trials on the various


types of high-grade materials will be completed over the coming two weeks which is critical to the


selection of the optimal mix of high-grade copper material. To date, the initial results have confirmed the


potential for Roan to maintain a significant increase in copper production rate on the high-grade copper


material which supports the decision to migrate Roan onto this high-grade material from initially


dedicating the capacity to the processing of copper tailings.


The various mineralogical compositions of the different materials required circuit adjustments to Roan to


optimally process each material. The final results from the trials have consequently been slightly delayed.


There remain two further material compositions that will be trialled over the coming two weeks to


complete the selection of the source material for a targeted long-term supply agreement.


The ramp-up of the Munkoyo Open-Pit mine operations remains on target to achieve 8 500tpm of high-


grade ROM exceeding 2% copper (equating to 170tpm) with a further 75 000tpm of lower grade ROM


stockpiled at the operations. In addition, the recently announced trading of 10Mt from the estimated


260Mt of material in Jubilee's Large Waste Project has commenced with first payments received.


Statement from Leon Coetzer, Jubilee CEO:


"To date, these trials have vindicated our decision to prioritise the processing of the high-grade copper


material. Over the past six weeks, four material types of varying grades and composition of copper within


the overall 6Mt of high-grade, previously mined material have been processed at Roan. Each material type


has shown a unique property that requires a dedicated processing configuration at Roan with varying


metallurgical performance.


The trials have been delayed slightly by the in-circuit adjustments to Roan, required to optimally process


the various compositions of materials. The early results have already confirmed the potential for a


significant and sustained improvement in copper production from Roan, while the ramp up at the


Company's Munkoyo mining operations remains on track to reach the 8 500 tpm of high-grade ROM."
