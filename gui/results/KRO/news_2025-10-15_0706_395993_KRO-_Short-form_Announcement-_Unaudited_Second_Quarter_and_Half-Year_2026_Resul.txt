Commentary from Zak Calisto, CEO and Founder:


"Our subscription revenue growth increased from 15% in FY25 Q2, to 20% in this quarter. We continue to


demonstrate our ability to accelerate our subscription revenue growth at scale, deliver strong earnings,


drive innovation, and increase our distribution capabilities while maintaining a strong, financially


disciplined, agile, innovative and owner-orientated culture. We believe that our strong unit economics


coupled with a clean balance sheet positions us favourably to continue to scale."


Outlook


We believe Karooooo remains strongly positioned for growth. We operate in an expanding and largely


underpenetrated market, fueled by robust and sustained customer demand. This demand is driven by a


heightened focus on digitalization, the need to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs, and


increasing attention to safety in physical operations.


Year to date, we have accelerated Cartrack subscription revenue growth by further expanding our


distribution footprint in existing markets, driving broader platform adoption, and capitalizing on growing


demand for video solutions. We are encouraged by our positive performance year to date as evidenced by


Cartrack's subscription revenue growth of 19% for the first 6 months of the fiscal year and ARR growth of


20% at 31 August 2025.


Our proven and profitable business model, underpinned by a strong balance sheet and healthy cash


position, gives us multiple levers for expansion. We believe our continuous investment in AI products,


platform and customer experience will generate robust results in the future.


We remain confident that our track record of success, specifically our ability to generate healthy cash flows,


is sustainable.


Actual results may differ materially from Karooooo's outlook due to various factors, including those


described under "Forward-Looking Statements" below and described under "Risk Factors" in our latest


Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.


As previously disclosed on June 11, 2025, Karooooo facilitated and launched an SEC-registered


underwritten secondary public offering (the "Offering") pursuant to Karooooo's registration statement on


Form F-3 (File No. 333-280758), as supplemented by a prospectus supplement, dated June 11, 2025, in


which Isaias (Zak) Jose Calisto offered and sold 1,500,000 Ordinary Shares at a price to the public of


USD50.00 per Ordinary Share for total gross proceeds to Mr.Calisto of approximately USD75,000,000. The


Offering closed on June 13, 2025 and was 3.3 times oversubscribed. Mr.Calisto remains the majority


shareholder with 58% of the issued shares.


After adjustment for the costs of the Offering, our guidance for FY 2026 remains unchanged. With Cartrack's


revenue making up the majority of group revenue, the guidance below relates primarily to Cartrack.


    -   Cartrack's subscription revenue between ZAR4,700 million and ZAR4,900 million, which implies


        Cartrack subscription revenue growth between 16% and 21%.


    -   Cartrack's operating profit margin between 26% and 31%.


    -   Karooooo's adjusted earnings per share (a non-IFRS measure) between ZAR32.50 and ZAR35.50.
