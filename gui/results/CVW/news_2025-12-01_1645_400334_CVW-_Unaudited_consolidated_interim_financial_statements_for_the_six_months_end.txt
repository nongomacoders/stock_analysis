NATURE OF THE BUSINESS


Castleview Property Fund is a property holding and investment company that was listed as a REIT on the AltX of the


JSE in 2017. Castleview invests in direct property investments ? where the Group owns the properties and indirect


property investments ? where property is owned via other real estate companies with separate management teams, with


the goal of maximising total returns to its shareholders.


TRADING PERFORMANCE


Group revenue reduced to R0.8 billion (2024: R1.1 billion) as a result of substantial property disposals within the Group,


particularly by Emira Property Fund Limited.


Income derived from equity-accounted investments increased to R360 million (2024: R166 million), driven by the


meaningful increase in the Group's holding in SA Corporate Real Estate Fund Limited ("SA Corporate"). During the


period, through a series of on-market transactions and the disposal of derivatives, the Group increased its shareholding


in SA Corporate to 22.62%, which has subsequently increased to 24.93%. As a result of the increase in SA Corporate


shares held, this investment is equity accounted and a gain on bargain purchase of R893.9 million was recognised.


Profit has decreased slightly to R1.5 billion (2024: R1.6 billion), primarily from the gain on bargain purchase, offset by


lower fair value gains on investment properties and financial assets.


The Group's investment activity has resulted in an increase in total assets to R24.8 billion (2024: R23.4 billion).


Castleview had a market capitalisation of R9.66 billion based on a share price of R9.54 at 30 September 2025 and a net


asset value of R10.38 billion, which equates to a net asset value of R10.24 per share. The loan-to-value ratio, net of


cash, is 45.5%.


DISTRIBUTION


The board approved and notice is hereby given of an interim gross dividend for the period 1 April 2025 to 30 September


2025 of 11.06830 cents per share.


The dividend is payable to Castleview shareholders in accordance with the timetable set out below:


 Last day to trade cum dividend                                                           Monday, 15 December 2025


 Shares trade ex-dividend                                                              Wednesday, 17 December 2025


 Record date                                                                              Friday, 19 December 2025


 Payment date                                                                             Monday, 22 December 2025


Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday, 17 December 2025 and Friday,


19 December 2025, both days inclusive. The dividend will be transferred to dematerialised shareholders' CSDP


accounts/broker accounts on Monday, 22 December 2025. Certificated shareholders' dividend payments will be paid


to certificated shareholders' bank accounts on or about Monday, 22 December 2025.


Tax treatment


In accordance with Castleview's status as a REIT, shareholders are advised that the dividend meets the requirements


of a "qualifying distribution" for the purposes of section 25BB of the Income Tax Act, No. 58 of 1962 ("Income Tax


Act"). Accordingly, qualifying distributions received by local tax residents must be included in the gross income of


such shareholders (as a non-exempt dividend in terms of section 10(1)(k)(aa) of the Income Tax Act), with the effect


that the qualifying distribution is taxable as income in the hands of the shareholder. These qualifying distributions are,


however, exempt from dividend withholding tax in the hands of South African tax resident shareholders, provided that


the South African resident shareholders have provided the following forms to their Central Securities Depository


Participant ("CSDP") or broker, as the case may be in respect of uncertificated shares, or the transfer secretaries, in


respect of certificated shares:


a)    a declaration that the dividend is exempt from dividends tax; and


b)    a written undertaking to inform the CSDP, broker or the transfer secretaries, as the case may be should the


      circumstances affecting the exemption change or the beneficial owner cease to be the beneficial owner,


both in the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service. Shareholders are advised to


contact their CSDP, broker or the transfer secretaries, as the case may be to arrange for the abovementioned documents


to be submitted prior to payment of the dividend, if such documents have not already been submitted.


Qualifying dividends received by non-resident shareholders will not be taxable as income and instead will be treated


as ordinary dividends, but which are exempt in terms of the usual dividend exemptions per section 10(1)(k) of the


Income Tax Act. Any distribution received by a non-resident from a REIT will be subject to dividend withholding tax


at 20% unless the rate is reduced in terms of any applicable agreement for the avoidance of double taxation ("DTA")


between South Africa and the country of residence of the shareholder. Assuming dividend withholding tax will be


withheld at a rate of 20%, the net amount due to non-resident shareholders will be 8.85464 cents per share. A reduced


dividend withholding tax rate in terms of the applicable DTA, may only be relied on if the non-resident shareholder


has provided the following forms to their CSDP or broker, as the case may be, in respect of the uncertificated shares,


or the transfer secretaries, in respect of certificated shares:


a)    a declaration that the dividend is subject to a reduced rate because of the application of a DTA; and


b)    a written undertaking to inform their CSDP, broker or the transfer secretaries, as the case may be should the


      circumstances affecting the reduced rate change or the beneficial owner cease to be the beneficial owner,


both in the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service. Non-resident shareholders


are advised to contact their CSDP, broker or the transfer secretaries, as the case may be to arrange for the


abovementioned documents to be submitted prior to payment of the dividend if such documents have not already been


submitted, if applicable.


Shares in issue at the date of declaration of the dividends: 1 012 964 669


Castleview's income tax reference number: 9366916188


The dividend may have tax implications for resident as well as non-resident shareholders. Shareholders are therefore


encouraged to consult their tax and/or professional advisors should they be in any doubt as to the appropriate action to


take.
