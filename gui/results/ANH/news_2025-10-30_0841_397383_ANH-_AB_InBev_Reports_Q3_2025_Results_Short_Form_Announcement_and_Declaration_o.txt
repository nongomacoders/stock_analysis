    8%. The outlook for FY25 reflects our current assessment of inflation and other macroeconomic conditions.


(ii) Net Finance Costs: Net pension interest expenses and accretion expenses are expected to be in the range


     of 190 to 220 million USD per quarter, depending on currency and interest rate fluctuations. We expect


     the average gross debt coupon in FY25 to be approximately 4%.


(iii)Effective Tax Rate (ETR): We expect the normalized ETR in FY25 to be in the range of 26% to 28%. The ETR


     outlook does not consider the impact of potential future changes in legislation.


(iv) Net Capital Expenditure: We expect net capital expenditure of between 3.5 and 4.0 billion USD in FY25.


INTERIM DIVIDEND


The board of directors of AB InBev has approved an interim dividend of Euro 0.15 per ordinary share ("the

Additional information required by the JSE Listings Requirements


1.   No transfers of shareholdings to and from South Africa will be permitted between Friday, 14 November 2025


     and Wednesday, 19 November 2025 (both dates inclusive). No dematerialisation or rematerialisation orders


     will be permitted between Tuesday, 18 November 2025 and Thursday, 20 November 2025 (both dates


     inclusive).


2.   The gross amount of the Dividend will be subject to a Belgian withholding tax of 30%. Such withholding tax


     may be reduced to 15% in terms of the double tax treaty in force between Belgium and South Africa. A rebate


     of the additional Belgian withholding tax imposed must be claimed in accordance with the relevant


     reimbursement process noted below. The Dividend will also be subject to South African dividends tax at the


     rate of 20% unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption. Any shareholder who receives a dividend which


     is subject to South African dividends tax (i.e., where no exemption is available) will qualify for a 15% reduction


     in dividends tax. The ultimate result in such a case is that a dividend will be subject to a reduced Belgian


     withholding tax rate of 15% and subject to South African dividends tax at a rate of 5%.


3.   At Thursday, 30 October 2025, being the declaration announcement date of the Dividend, the Company had


     a total of 1,952,725,159 shares in issue (excluding treasury shares). The Company held 66,516,814 ordinary


     shares in treasury giving a total issued share capital of 2,019,241,973 shares (of which 1,797,199,973


     ordinary shares are listed and 222,042,000 restricted shares are unlisted).


4.   The Dividend will be paid out of the Company's operating results for 2025, increased with the profits carried


     over, without drawing on any capital reserves.


5.   The Dividend is payable in South African Rand to shareholders whose shares are held through Central


     Securities Participants and brokers traded on the JSE.


South African income tax and dividends tax consequences


The Dividend should be regarded as a 'foreign dividend' for South African income tax and South African dividends


tax purposes.


Foreign dividends received in respect of shares which are dual listed on the JSE are, however, exempt from income


tax. Consequently, no South African income tax should be incurred by the shareholders in respect of the Dividend


received.


The Dividend may, however, be subject to South African dividends tax at 20%. There is though, amongst others,


an exemption from South African dividends tax if the Dividend is paid to a South African resident corporate


shareholder. This exemption operates in a manner similar to other local shares listed on the JSE and the dividends


paid in respect thereof to resident corporate shareholders and retirement funds. Intermediaries may only allow an


exemption from South African dividends tax, provided shareholders have completed and lodged a valid exemption


form, which is obtainable from their intermediary.


Belgian withholding tax


The gross amount of the Dividend will as a rule be subject to a Belgian withholding tax of 30%. Such withholding


tax can under certain circumstances be reduced.


Belgian dividend withholding tax can be reduced to 15% pursuant to the Belgian-South African double tax treaty


in force. Such reduced rate can be applied provided that Form N°/NR. 276 Div.-Aut. is filed by the shareholder


with the Bureau Central de Taxation de Bruxelles-Etranger, boulevard du Jardin Botanique 50 boîte 3429, 1000


Brussels, Belgium (hereinafter the "Central Bureau of Taxation") before the expiry of a period of five years from


January 1st of the year in which the withholding tax was paid, in which case the differential between the standard


withholding tax rate of 30% and the reduced treaty rate of 15% will be reimbursed.


An explanatory note is available through this link, or through the Belgian Tax authorities' official website:


https://finance.belgium.be/sites/default/files/downloads/167-276-div-note.pdf


The current version of Form N°/NR. 276 Div.-Aut. is available through this link, or through the Belgian Tax


authorities' official website: https://fin.belgium.be/sites/default/files/media/documents/276-div-nl-fr-de-en.pdf


A Belgian withholding tax exemption is also applicable to dividends paid to South African corporate shareholders


that hold a participation of less than 10% in the capital of AB InBev but with an acquisition value of at least ?2.5


million. This regime is subject to the cumulative conditions that (i) the company is treated as a body corporate for


tax purposes in the meaning of Article 3, 1), d) of the Double Tax Treaty between Belgium and South Africa and


has a legal form considered similar to the ones listed in Annex I, Part A, to the Council Directive 2011/96/EU of


30 November 2011 on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and


subsidiaries of different Member States, as amended by Directive 2014/863/EU of 8 July 2014; (ii) it is subject


to corporate income tax or a similar tax without benefiting from a tax regime that deviates from the ordinary


domestic tax regime; (iii) the dividends relate to AB InBev shares which it has held or will hold in full legal ownership


for an uninterrupted period of at least one year; (iv) the dividends relate to AB InBev shares which qualify as fixed


financial assets under Belgian accounting law in the books of the shareholder and (v) it cannot in principle credit


the Belgian withholding tax paid on the AB InBev dividends or obtain a refund thereof according to the legal


provisions in force on December 31 of the year preceding the year of the payment or attribution of the dividends.


In order to benefit from this withholding tax exemption, the shareholder must provide the Central Bureau of


Taxation with a South African residency certificate confirming that it fulfils the abovementioned conditions and


indicating to what extent the Belgian withholding tax is in principle creditable or reimbursable on the basis of the


South African laws applicable on 31 December of the year preceding the one during which the Dividend is paid or


attributed.


South African dividends tax rebate in respect of Belgian withholding tax


A rebate must, for South African dividends tax purposes, be deducted from any South African dividends tax payable


in respect of the Dividend (i.e. where no exemption is available). This rebate will be equal to the amount of any


Belgian withholding tax paid in respect of the Dividend, without any right of recovery, and must not exceed the


amount of the South African dividends tax imposed in respect of the Dividend.


The CSDPs and/or brokers, in their capacity as the regulated intermediaries, must obtain proof of any Belgian


withholding tax paid and deducted from the South African tax payable, as above, in the form and manner


prescribed by the South African Revenue Service.


For the avoidance of doubt, the income tax and dividends tax information provided above is only relevant to


shareholders whose shares are held through CSDPs and brokers and are traded on the JSE.


Any shareholder who is in any doubt as to their tax position should seek independent professional advice.
