2025 OUTLOOK

    (ii)  Net Finance Costs: Net pension interest expenses and accretion expenses are expected to be in the range of 190 to


          220 million USD per quarter, depending on currency and interest rate fluctuations. We expect the average gross debt


          coupon in FY25 to be approximately 4%.


    (iii) Effective Tax Rate (ETR): We expect the normalized ETR in FY25 to be in the range of 26% to 28%. The ETR outlook


          does not consider the impact of potential future changes in legislation.


    (iv)  Net Capital Expenditure: We expect net capital expenditure of between 3.5 and 4.0 billion USD in FY25.
