DIVIDEND FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 31 AUGUST 2025


The group's distributable income increased by 7.8% to R3.6 billion, compared to R3.4 billion


in the prior year.


The board has declared a dividend of 25.42271 cents per share for the six months ended


31 August 2025.


The dividend is payable to Redefine's shareholders in accordance with the timetable set


out below:


Last date to trade cum dividend:                          Tuesday, 18 November 2025


Shares trade ex dividend:                                 Wednesday, 19 November 2025


Record date:                                              Friday, 21 November 2025


Payment date:                                             Monday, 24 November 2025


Shareholders may not dematerialise or rematerialise their shares between Wednesday,


19 November 2025, and Friday, 21 November 2025, both days inclusive. Payment of the


dividend will be made to shareholders on Monday, 24 November 2025. In respect of


dematerialised shareholders, the dividend will be transferred to the CSDP accounts/broker


accounts on Monday, 24 November 2025. Certificated shareholders' dividend payments


will be deposited on or about Monday, 24 November 2025.


In accordance with Redefine's status as a REIT, shareholders are advised that the dividend


meets the requirements of a "qualifying distribution" for the purposes of section 25BB of the


Income Tax Act, No 58 of 1962 ("Income Tax Act"). The distribution on the shares will be


deemed to be a dividend for South African tax purposes in terms of section 25BB of the


Income Tax Act.


The dividend received by or accrued to South African tax residents must be included in the


gross income of such shareholders and will not be exempt from income tax (in terms of the


exclusion to the general dividend exemption, contained in paragraph (aa) of section


10(1)(k)(i) of the Income Tax Act) because it is a dividend distributed by a REIT. This


dividend is, however, exempt from dividend withholding tax in the hands of South African


tax resident shareholders, provided that the South African resident shareholders provided


the following forms to their central securities depository participant ("CSDP") or broker, as


the case may be, in respect of uncertificated shares, or the company, in respect of


certificated shares:


-   declaration that the dividend is exempt from dividends tax; and


-   written undertaking to inform the CSDP, broker or the company, as the case may be,


    should the circumstances affecting the exemption change or the beneficial owner cease


    to be the beneficial owner,


    both in the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service.


Shareholders are advised to contact their CSDP, broker or the company, as the case may


be, to arrange for the abovementioned documents to be submitted prior to payment of the


dividend if such documents have not already been submitted.


Dividends received by non-resident shareholders will not be taxable as income and instead


will be treated as an ordinary dividend which is exempt from income tax in terms of the


general dividend exemption in section 10(1)(k)(i) of the Income Tax Act. Assuming dividend


withholding tax will be withheld at a rate of 20% (unless the rate is reduced in terms of any


applicable agreement for the avoidance of double taxation ("DTA") between South Africa


and the country of residence of the shareholder), the net dividend amount due to non-


resident shareholders is 20.33817cents per share.


A reduced dividend withholding rate in terms of the applicable DTA may only be relied upon


if the non-resident shareholder has provided the following forms to their CSDP or broker,


as the case may be, in respect of uncertificated shares, or the company, in respect of


certificated shares:


-   declaration that the distribution is subject to a reduced rate as a result of the application


    of a DTA; and


-   a written undertaking to inform their CSDP, broker or the company, as the case may be,


    should the circumstances affecting the reduced rate change or the beneficial owner


    cease to be the beneficial owner,


    both in the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service.


Non-resident shareholders are advised to contact their CSDP, broker or the company, as


the case may be, to arrange for the abovementioned documents to be submitted prior to


payment of the distribution if such documents have not already been submitted, if


applicable.


Shares in issue at the date of declaration of dividend: 7 202 600 656


Redefine's income tax reference number: 917/852/484/0


PROSPECTS


Redefine has shown remarkable resilience, adapting to economic fluctuations and evolving


real estate dynamics. The group's focus on foresight, adaptability and localised nuances


has been key in navigating the changing landscape. By opting for the upside and


concentrating on the variables under its control, Redefine has emphasised the importance


of location, demand and supply dynamics, development potential, and economic signals.


Sustainability and proactive operational risk management have become fundamental pillars


for long-term value creation, highlighting Redefine's enduring appeal and strategic vision.


The primary drivers of outperformance for Redefine have been portfolio quality and balance


sheet strength. The group's strategy remains firm, focusing on disciplined capital allocation


for sustainable growth, recycling non-core assets, simplifying joint ventures to reduce the


see-through LTV ratio, and delivering on earnings guidance. The future is shaped by


flexibility, sustainability and technology, with the upside of us at the core. The outlook is


characterised by cautious optimism as Redefine continues on its path of positive total


returns.


Although we operate in a highly uncertain environment, we expect distributable income per


share for FY26 to grow by between 4.0% and 6.0%, being between 54.5 and 55.5 cents


per share (FY25: 52.39 cents per share). Over the full year, we anticipate applying a


dividend payout ratio of between 80% and 90%, dependent on operational capital


expenditure requirements, debt covenant levels, liquidity events, and tax considerations.


This forecast is predicated on the assumption that current trading conditions will prevail.


Forecast rental income is based on contractual terms and anticipated market-related


renewals. The forecast has not been reviewed or reported on by the group's independent


external auditors. Redefine's use of dividend per share as a relevant measure of financial


performance remains unchanged.
