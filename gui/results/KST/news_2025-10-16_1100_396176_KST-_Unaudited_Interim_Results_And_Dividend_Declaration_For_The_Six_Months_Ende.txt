UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS AND DIVIDEND DECLARATION FOR THE SIX MONTHS


ENDED 31 AUGUST 2025


1.   FINANCIAL RESULTS


     ? Recurring headline earnings per share increased by 21% to 58.1 cents per share


     ? Dividend per share increased by 18% to 20.0 cents per share


     ? Total assets under management increased by 19% to R517.6bn


     ? Gross written premium increased by 6% to R4.0bn


     Note: All amounts contained in this short-form announcement are presented in ZAR.


     PSG delivered a 21% increase in recurring headline earnings per share and a return on


     equity of 28.6%.


     While operating conditions remained challenging, more favourable securities market


     conditions impacted positively on the group's results during the period. Our key financial


     metrics under these conditions highlight the competitive advantage of our advice-led


     business model. Total assets under management increased by 19% to R517.6 billion,


     comprising assets managed by PSG Wealth of R448.9 billion (18% increase) and PSG


     Asset Management of R68.7 billion (21% increase), while PSG Insure's gross written


     premium amounted to R4.0 billion (6% increase). Performance fees constituted 7.3%


     (2024: 6.0%) of headline earnings.


     The firm remains confident about its long-term growth prospects, and we therefore


     continued to invest in both technology and people. Compared to the prior comparable


     period, our technology and infrastructure spend increased by 15% (these costs continue


     to be fully expensed), while our fixed remuneration cost grew by 5%. We are proud of the


     progress made in growing our own talent, with 73 newly qualified graduates having joined


     during the period.


     PSG's key financial performance indicators for the six months ended 31 August 2025 are


     shown below.

     ^ Includes a R51.0 million profit on sale of the Western National Insurance Namibia business to Santam Namibia.


     The sale was concluded on 3 March 2025, after the fulfilment of suspensive conditions. The assets and liabilities


     relating to this business were previously recognised as held-for-sale.


     Capital management


     PSG's capital cover ratio remains strong at 299% (2024: 286%) based on the latest


     insurance group return. This comfortably exceeds the minimum regulatory requirement of


     100%. During July 2025, Global Credit Rating Company upgraded the group's long-term


     and short-term credit ratings to AA-(ZA) from A+(ZA) and to A1+(ZA) from A1(ZA)


     respectively, with a Stable Outlook. This being the fifth rating upgrade which the group


     has received over the last ten years. The increase in the group's capital cover ratio and


     the credit rating affirmation is testament to the group's strong financial position and


     excellent liquidity.


     PSG continues to generate strong cash flows, which gives us various options to optimise


     our capital structure and risk-adjusted returns to the benefit of shareholders:


         ? The group repurchased and cancelled 6.7 million shares at a cost of R147.3 million


            during the period as part of shareholder capital optimisation.


         ? Our shareholder investable asset's exposure to equity marginally increased to


            10% (9% in the comparable period). We continue to monitor investment markets


            and will gradually increase our value at risk exposure to align with our long-term


            target.


2.   INTERIM DIVIDEND DECLARATION


     Considering the strong cash position, the board declared an interim gross dividend of 20.0


     ZAR cents per share from income reserves for the period ended 31 August 2025 (2024:


     17.0 ZAR cents per share). The group's dividend pay-out ratio remains between 40% to


     60% of full year recurring headline earnings excluding intangible asset amortisation.


     The dividend is subject to a South African dividend withholding tax ("DWT") rate of 20%,


     unless the shareholder is exempt from paying dividend tax or is entitled to a reduced rate


     in terms of the applicable double-tax agreement. Including DWT at 20% results in a net


     dividend of 16.0 ZAR cents (2024: 13.6 ZAR cents) per share. The number of issued


     ordinary shares is 1 253 500 834 at the date of this declaration. PSG Financial Services'


     income tax reference number is 9550/644/07/5.


     The salient dates of the dividend declaration are:


     Declaration date                                         Thursday, 16 October 2025


     Last day to trade cum dividend                           Tuesday, 4 November 2025


     Trading ex-dividend commences                            Wednesday, 5 November 2025


     Record date                                              Friday, 7 November 2025


     Date of payment                                          Monday, 10 November 2025


     As the dividend has been declared and denominated in ZAR, it will be paid (in ZAR) into


     the bank accounts of shareholders appearing on the Mauritian register.


     Share certificates may not be dematerialised or rematerialised between Wednesday,


     5 November 2025 and Friday, 7 November 2025, both days inclusive.


3.   LOOKING FORWARD


     PSG is a proudly South African company, and we believe in the people and potential of


     our country. We also firmly believe that well-functioning capital markets remain a critical


     success factor for economic growth. As a responsible corporate citizen, we are committed


     to playing an active role in driving progress. Through the Think Big competition, run in


     collaboration with Economic Research South Africa, PSG aims to stimulate debate among


     thought leaders which will unearth actionable solutions to drive sustainable economic


     growth.


     Following a decade of subdued growth, the South African economy has begun to show


     signs of cautious optimism. However, the country stands at a crossroads, where reform-


     driven momentum is balanced against persistent structural challenges. Energy


     constraints, logistics bottlenecks and high unemployment remain critical hurdles, further


     compounded by global uncertainties. While the Government of National Unity and private-


     sector collaboration offer hope, sustainable economic progress will depend on bold


     reforms and professional management of both internal and external environments.


     We remain aware that it will take time to resolve the country's economic and societal


     challenges. PSG however continues to be confident in our long-term prospects and


     strategy and will therefore sustain investment in our businesses. We will monitor local and


     global developments and adjust our approach where necessary to ensure sustainable


     growth and value creation for clients and other stakeholders.
