Information for shareholders


The information below is included only as a general guide to taxation for shareholders based


on Shaftesbury Capital's understanding of the law and the practice currently in force. Any


shareholder who is in any doubt as to their tax position should seek independent professional


advice.


UK shareholders


Certain categories of shareholders may be eligible for exemption from the 20 per cent UK


withholding tax and may register to receive their dividends on a gross basis. Further


information, including the required forms, is available from the 'Investor Information'


section of the Company's website (https://www.shaftesburycapital.com/en/investors/investor-


information.html), or on request from the Company's UK registrar, MUFG Corporate Markets.


Validly completed forms must be received by MUFG Corporate Markets no later than the


dividend record date, as advised; otherwise the dividend will be paid after deduction of tax.


Cash dividends paid directly to bank or building society account


Cash dividend payments made by the Company are only paid by electronic means. The Company


no longer issues payments by cheque. To receive cash dividends, shareholders must ensure


that they have registered their bank/building society details with the appropriate


registrar. Visit the dividend information section of our website for more details


(https://www.shaftesburycapital.com/en/investors/investor-information/dividend-


information.html).


South African shareholders


The 2025 interim cash dividend declared by the Company is a foreign payment and the funds


are sourced from the UK.


PID: A 20 per cent UK withholding tax is applicable to a PID. South African shareholders


may apply to HMRC after payment of the PID element of the 2025 interim cash dividend for


a refund of the difference between the 20 per cent UK withholding tax and the UK/South


African double taxation treaty rate of 15 per cent.


The PID element of the 2025 interim cash dividend will be exempt from income tax but will


constitute a dividend for Dividends Tax purposes, as it will be declared in respect of a


share listed on the exchange operated by the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. South African


Dividends Tax will therefore be withheld from the PID element of the 2025 interim cash


dividend at a rate of 20 per cent, unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption and


the prescribed requirements for effecting the exemption are in place by the requisite


date. Certain shareholders may also qualify for a reduction of South Africa Dividends Tax


liability to 5 per cent, (being the difference between the South African dividends tax


rate and the effective UK withholding tax rate of 15 per cent) if the prescribed


requirements for effecting the reduction are in place by the requisite date.


Non-PID: The Non-PID element of the 2025 interim cash dividend will be exempt from income


tax but will constitute a dividend for South African Dividends Tax purposes, as it will


be declared in respect of a share listed on the exchange operated by the Johannesburg


Stock Exchange. South African Dividends Tax will therefore be withheld from the Non-PID


element of the 2025 interim cash dividend at a rate of 20 per cent, unless a shareholder


qualifies for an exemption and the prescribed requirements for effecting the exemption


are in place by the requisite date.


Other overseas shareholders


Other non-UK shareholders may be able to make claims for a refund of UK withholding tax


deducted pursuant to the application of a relevant double taxation convention. UK


withholding tax refunds can only be claimed from HMRC, the UK tax authority.
