REVIEWED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2025


"The first half (H1) of 2025 saw a consolidation of the growth generated by NEPI Rockcastle's strategy of consistently investing


in premium properties with strong fundamentals. The transactions completed in 2024 and the continuous improvement in the


existing portfolio through active asset management led to a 12.1% growth in net operating income (NOI), against a challenging


macroeconomic background. The strong operating performance of our properties lifted the value of NEPI Rockcastle's


investment property portfolio to more than EUR8 billion for the first time in its history. The high demand for our quality retail


assets translated also into a low vacancy rate of 1.6%. We continue to add value through developments, not least in the


renewable energy sector, which has the potential to become an important growth segment for the Group once the current


ongoing major investments therein are completed.


In H1 2025, we delivered a 3.1% growth in distributable earnings per share relative to H1 2024. Our loan-to-value (LTV) ratio


is very conservative by industry standards at 32.1%, which allows NEPI Rockcastle to pay 90% of its earnings as dividends, a


higher distribution rate than most of our peers. I am proud to see that NEPI Rockcastle today combines an established portfolio


with a rock-solid balance sheet and a sustainable growth story, all driven by our highly knowledgeable people, which should set


the stage for future success and strong results for our shareholders for many years to come."


Rudiger Dany, Chief Executive Officer (CEO)


DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS


-   Distributable earnings per share (DEPS) were 31.05 euro cents for the six months to 30 June 2025, 3.1% higher than in H1


    2024.


DIVIDEND DECLARATION


The Board has declared a dividend of 27.95 euro cents per share for H1 2025, corresponding to a 90% dividend pay-out ratio,


to be settled in cash, as a capital repayment (default option). Shareholders can also elect for the settlement of the same dividend


amount as a cash dividend out of distributable profits.


In line with Dutch legislation, the capital repayment will be paid to shareholders unless they elect to receive the cash dividend.


A circular containing full details of the dividend settlement, accompanied by announcements on the Stock Exchange News


Service (SENS) of the JSE, A2X and Euronext Amsterdam will be issued in due course.


OUTLOOK


The Board has revised the guidance released in February 2025, based on the good operational results, and now expects DEPS


for the year to be 2.5-3% higher than the DEPS of 60.17 cents per share in 2024.


This guidance does not consider any impact of potential geopolitical instability, or major macroeconomic disruptions, and


assumes current trading trends continue. This guidance can be modified or withdrawn in the future if material changes unfold.


This guidance has not been reviewed or reported on by NEPI Rockcastle's auditors and is the responsibility of the Board of


Directors.
