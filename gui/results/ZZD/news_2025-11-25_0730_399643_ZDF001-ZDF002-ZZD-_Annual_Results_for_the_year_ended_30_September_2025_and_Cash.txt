ANNUAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025 AND CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION


Zeda has achieved a strong set of results, underscoring our solid return on invested


capital, profit margins, and remarkable double-digit growth in both earnings and


operating profit. These accomplishments are especially significant given the


challenging trading environment we navigated. Our results are a testament to the


strength and robustness of our diversified business model, which has effectively


countered the pressures facing traditional car rental services and vehicle sales.


Amid these challenges, our strategic focus on Leasing, Subscription, and the


expansion of the Greater Africa business has proven invaluable, enabling us to


offset the impact of declining used-car sales volumes. By rigorously adhering to


our operating model - focusing on prudent financing, strategic purchasing, efficient


utilisation, and judicious disposal - we have not only optimised our fleet composition


but also achieved higher utilisation rates and an advantageous sales mix. Furthermore,


our proactive approach has enabled us to contain our operating expenses below inflation,


thereby enhancing our overall performance.

The automotive sector is facing structural changes, including the influx of vehicles from


Asian vehicle manufacturers, and US tariffs that have negatively impacted the value chain.


In South Africa, the economy is showing modest growth, whereas Zambia, Namibia, and Ghana


are witnessing stronger economic performance. However, political instability in Mozambique


has constrained progress observed over the past three years. Despite this, we remain


optimistic as we have started to see positive developments toward the end of the financial year.


The shift in the new-car market has exerted downward pressure on the prices of used vehicles,


particularly one-year-old models. To mitigate margin dilution, we extended the lives of rental


vehicles and sold them at an optimal age. Although this tactical response has led to a 14.6%


decrease in used car sales volume and a 4.1% decline in revenue, it has also boosted profit


margins. The Car Rental Business achieved a 2.1% increase in rental days, because of strategic


commercial partners, local leisure, and the subscription business, in line with our strategy


of driving the usership economy. On the other hand, the replacement business has been adversely


affected by lower insurance claims, aggressive pricing in the inbound business, and customers


buying down, resulting in overall short-term revenue declining by 2.6% for purely rental business,


excluding the sales business.


Operational discipline in the management of car rental vehicles, out-of-service vehicles, and


reduced damage incidents has significantly improved utilisation from 71% to 73% year on year.


The Leasing Business continued its growth, rising by 15.7% across our Sub-Saharan operations.


The growth trajectory is in line with our strategic focus on corporate leasing, heavy commercial,


and the Greater Africa region.


During the year, we focused on cost efficiencies, and contained operating expenses below the


inflation rate for the year. This saw gross profit increasing by 3.9% to R4 353 million, with a


gross profit margin of 40.9%. Both EBITDA and the EBITDA margin were maintained at R3 359 million


and 32%, respectively. We grew operating profit by 10.8% and expanded the operating margin by


100 basis points to 15% compared to the prior year.


Our funding diversification strategy proved successful, reducing the risk of refinancing


highlighted by the rating agency in the prior year. We entered the debt capital markets and signed


a Common Terms Agreement ("CTA") to bolster our long-term funding sources. By year end, 60% of our


debt was long term and 77% was unsecured. Net debt rose to R5 176 million to support fleet leasing


growth, ending the year with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5x. The return on equity ("ROE")


reached 21.9%, with a capital structure of 65:35. Our annual review and credit opinion maintains


our investment-grade rating and stable outlook.


We delivered an impressive return to shareholders, with headline earnings per share ("HEPS") and


basic earnings per share ("BEPS") increasing by 15.7% and 12.5% to 361 and 360 cents per share,


respectively. We also achieved a return on invested capital ("ROIC") of 14.7%, which exceeded the


weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") of 10.8%.


In addition, the Board returned cash to shareholders by declaring a final dividend of


126 cents per share. For the full financial year 2025, the Board has declared an annual dividend


of 181 cents, representing a 50% annual dividend payout ratio in line with our dividend policy of


30% to 50% of net profit after tax.

OUTLOOK STATEMENT


Zeda has been listed for three years. Our journey began with a deliberate strategic pillar to


establish a strong foundation for environmental, social and governance ("ESG") principles -


because we believe that sustainable growth and responsible leadership are inextricably linked.


Funding was also a focus point for diversifying and optimising our balance sheet to drive growth


and secure strong returns on investment. This disciplined approach has not only facilitated growth


but has also enhanced our financial capability, positioning us to capitalise on transformative


opportunities.


Our business operates in the automotive industry, enabling customers from the corporate, retail,


and public sectors to access vehicles for use in various sectors of the economy across Sub-Saharan


countries. We complete the cycle by selling those vehicles at the end of their useful lives or at


the end of a contract.


The automotive industry continues to grow and undergo a fundamental shift, driven by strong sales


from the Asian automakers, particularly Japan and China. Additionally, the use of vehicles rather


than traditional vehicle ownership is still in its early stages.


With this in mind, our strategy of deepening the usership economy remains our true north. Traction


is evident in the growth of the leasing portfolio across South Africa and Greater Africa, along


with subscription and car sales businesses. These growth pillars provide us with access to vehicles,


markets, and disposal channels, which are essential to the business fundamentals and have enabled


us to achieve a revenue of R10.6 billion.


The Board has approved an inorganic growth strategy that includes expanding into mobility-related


adjacencies, asset-light businesses, and extending our geographical footprint. Furthermore, the


Board has also approved an Africa strategy as we execute our plan to grow the contribution of


Greater Africa to the Group's revenue. Avis Budget Group ("ABG") has extended Zeda's operating


licences on the continent to include East, Central, and West Africa. Zeda has adequate balance


sheet capacity and access to funding to support inorganic growth.


Due to the extended ABG licence coverage beyond Southern Africa to include countries in East,


West and Central Africa, the Group now has access to the available markets within these regions.


This expanded footprint positions the Group to pursue a more cohesive strategy for Africa.


In addition, the performance of the Ghana business has improved as a result of strengthened


contracting discipline and operational enhancements. Consequently, the Board resolved to retain


the operation in Ghana. It is no longer regarded as an isolated asset, but as a strategic anchor


from which the Group can serve the West African region under ABG's broadened licence framework.


Targeted capital allocation to this market is therefore strategically justified.


Furthermore the Board approved the IT and the Data strategies, which will be deployed over the


medium term. The strategies aim to propel Zeda into a mobility integrated business underpinned


by technology and data analytics. Successful implementation of the IT and Data initiatives will


support the customer-centricity model, strengthen our competitive advantage, enhance customer


experience, support business growth and solidify Zeda as a leader in the mobility sector.


As we embark on the execution of the digital journey, pursue new avenues for innovation and drive


growth, the Board has elevated strategy execution to a strategic risk. This decision ensures that


we monitor strategy deployment and consequently generate an appropriate return on investment.


Strategic execution partnerships will also be key to delivering on this strategic goal.
