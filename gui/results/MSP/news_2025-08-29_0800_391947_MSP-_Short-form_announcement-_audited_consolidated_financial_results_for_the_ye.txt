SHORT-FORM ANNOUNCEMENT: AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR TO 30 JUNE 2025


INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND


MAS (hereafter Group or Company) performed very well, generating a total shareholders' return (TSR) of 12% for


the financial year to 30 June 2025. The Group achieved distributable earnings on an IFRS basis of 9.53 eurocents per


share for the 2025 financial year (27.7% increase year-on-year). Of this, 4.44 eurocents per share relate to the second


half of the financial year, which is within MAS' previously published, narrowed, IFRS basis distributable earnings


guidance range of 4.28 to 4.70 eurocents per share, for the six months to 30 June 2025. MAS' financial results and


progress with strategic matters are detailed within this commentary.


Unless otherwise stated, amounts included in this commentary are presented with reference to International


Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) based reported results. Segmental reporting, prepared on a proportionate


consolidated basis, is disclosed in the Group's financial results, to assist in the interpretation of IFRS financial results.


Detailed financial results and Company Profile (updated on 30 June 2025), including highlights and supplemental


operational information, are available on MAS' corporate website.


The Group remains committed to maximising total long-term returns from property investments on a per share basis,


aimed to be achieved by continued focus on capital allocation, operational excellence, sensible leveraging, and cost


efficiency. MAS operates directly-owned income property in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and employs capital


in commercial and residential developments owned indirectly via the Development Joint Venture (DJV(1)). MAS is


well positioned to provide its shareholders with best-in-class total long-term returns due to the long-term, continual


high growth in consumption in CEE, and leveraging its strong asset prospects and asset management capabilities to


generate robust like-for-like (LFL) net rental income (NRI) growth from retail operations through increasing tenants'


sales and implementing asset management initiatives, as well as its downside-protected exposure to high-quality


commercial and residential developments via DJV.


FINANCIAL RESULTS


The Group generates returns from: (i) directly-owned income property and operations in CEE; (ii) Central and


Eastern European investments with Prime Kapital in DJV (including equity-accounted earnings from its proportion


of completed DJV-owned income properties, net results of its residential sales, development activities and


investments in MAS shares); (iii) remaining directly-owned Western European income property (Flensburg Galerie),


and (iv) investments in financial instruments (including other elements disclosed as Corporate).


MAS' IFRS earnings for the financial year to 30 June 2025 were EUR125.0million, comprising distributable earnings


of EUR65.6million (EUR51.3million for the previous financial year, to 30 June 2024) and non-distributable earnings of


EUR59.4million (EUR71.9million for the previous financial year). IFRS tangible net asset value (TNAV) on 30 June 2025


was EUR1.86 per share (12% increase year on year; EUR1.66 per share on 30 June 2024). IFRS distributable earnings were


9.53 eurocents per share (27.7% increase year-on-year; 7.46 eurocents per share for the financial year to 30 June


2024), of which 4.44 eurocents per share relate to the second half of the financial year and is within MAS' previously


published, narrowed, IFRS basis distributable earnings guidance range of 4.28 to 4.70 eurocents per share, for the


six months to 30 June 2025.


The Group's exceptional financial performance is due to several factors which positively impacted MAS' IFRS earnings


compared to the previous financial year, including:


(i)   retail properties' exceptional operational performance in CEE, leading to 6.6% like-for-like (LFL) increase in


      passing NRI and improved asset valuations, supported by excellent rental and service charge collections;


(ii)  greater DJV profits, and MAS  share thereof, mainly due to (a) the outstanding performance of DJV s existing


      commercial properties, as well as the opening of Mall Moldova (Iasi, Romania) in April 2025, which led to substantial


      improvements in passing NRI, and increases in commercial asset valuations, (b) significantly reduced losses of the


      residential business (which are net of Development Margin and Fixed Dividend that were capitalised and subsequently


      released through cost of sales), and


(iii) increased finance income from MAS' EUR41.9million further investments in preferred equity issued by DJV during the twelve


      months to 30 June 2025 and the full-year impact of preferred equity investments made during the previous financial year.


The above positive variances were partially offset by the outcome of strategic initiatives aimed at maximising total


long-term returns to shareholders, as follows:


(i)   realised gains on MAS bonds repurchased during the first six months of the financial year to 30 June 2024 not repeated


      in the current financial year;


(ii)  increases in interest expenditure due to substantial additional secured debt contracted by the Group in preparation for


      repayment of its funding commitments, including the upcoming maturity of the bond in May 2026, net of income derived from


      placing the proceeds in bank deposits and invested in financial assets;


(iii) completion of Western European disposals during the previous financial year, mostly in respect of Arches street


      retail units (UK), leading to a decrease in profits from discontinued operations;


(iv)  increases in current and deferred taxes, the former related to higher operational income and the gradual reduction of tax


      losses available to offset profits achieved by operational properties, and the latter in the context of increasing property


      market values and reducing fiscal bases of operational properties, and


(v)   higher corporate and investment expenses associated with the substantial increase in corporate actions, and asset disposals,


      as well as other capital allocation initiatives pursued during the financial year to 30 June 2025.


DEBT, COST OF DEBT AND LIQUIDITY


On 30 June 2025, MAS had EUR205.1million in cash, money market instruments and undrawn credit facilities. Group's management


achieved considerable progress in raising new secured debt finance, having drawn down EUR90.5million of additional secured debt


during the financial year to 30 June 2025. The Group is finalising documentation for an additional EUR45million of secured debt,


which is expected to be drawn down by 30 September 2025. This will refinance a EUR22.9million secured debt facility maturing in


December 2025. On 31 January 2025, MAS and DJV concluded the disposal of their respective strip mall assets in Romania, collecting


a combined EUR52.3million.


Following a strategic review in June 2023, MAS implemented a revised debt management plan that was put in place, supplemented


by a suspension of dividend payments, with the aim to reduce the refinancing risks associated with MAS' bond maturity in


May 2026 and to ensure MAS is able to meet its funding commitments to the same date. In the context of the rising interest rate


environment at the time, which brought about major changes in the debt capital markets for high-yield real estate issuers,


substantially reducing MAS' access to unsecured funding and access to such financing by maturity of its bond due in May 2026,


the debt management plan focused on raising bank funding secured on all of MAS' unencumbered properties in CEE. To date,


substantial progress was achieved with secured debt raised on all but one of MAS' directly-owned assets.


Table 1 below sets out the Group's commitments on 30 June 2025 (including its outstanding capital commitments to the DJV,


capital expenditure (CapEx) requirements and debt amortisation payments) based on the assumption that MAS suspends dividends,


and does not receive distributions from the DJV before the 2026 bond matures. This analysis does not take into account


subsequent developments related to PK Investments Limited (PKI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the DJV) Voluntary Bid, including


DJV's undertaking to prioritise distributions of available profits to new investments (which undertaking must still be accepted),


and PKI's statement regarding a special distribution to MAS and Prime Kapital. Taking these subsequent developments into


consideration, it is likely that the liquidity shortfall will be remedied.

(2) Estimated debt amortisations, maturities and raising fees.


(3) Cash and near cash instruments include cash and cash equivalents and financial investments in money market funds but exclude


    cash in debt service reserve accounts and tenants' guarantees.


On 30 June 2025, the Group had EUR553.5million of outstanding debt (bonds and secured bank loans, EUR475.4millon on


30 June 2024), and its loan-to-value (LTV) ratio was 23.2% on an IFRS consolidated basis (26.3% on 30 June 2024).


As a result of the Group having amassed substantial liquidity from secured debt drawn down, MAS has placed part


of its cash in low-volatility, short-term financial investments (money market instruments), which provide slightly


higher yields than bank deposits, with similar or lower risk exposure. On 30 June 2025, the Group had EUR47.9million


invested in money market fund units, which management considers as 'near cash' instruments for operational purposes,


as these are readily convertible to cash, with 24-hour notice.


MAS' weighted average cost of debt (WACD) for the period, on an IFRS consolidated basis, remained relatively


constant at 5.51% per annum (5.52% for the financial year to 30 June 2024). Except for MAS' undrawn revolving


credit facility, exposure to interest rates for all secured debt is hedged. The Group hedges its interest rate exposure,


typically via interest rate caps, protecting against future increases in variable EURIBOR rates over loans' terms to maturity.


The Group's self-imposed, long-term overall debt limit is a maximum LTV ratio of 35%, or, on a forward-looking basis,


six times NRI, which is considerably more restrictive than its covenant tolerances. On 30 June 2025, the Group's


secured debt, bond and unsecured facility ratios demonstrated satisfactory headroom compared to covenant


tolerances, where applicable on both IFRS and proportionate consolidation bases. Table 2 below sets out the


relevant unsecured debt covenants.

On 30 June 2025, DJV's liquidity comprised EUR73.6million in cash, and secured debt of EUR87.2million, secured against


two of DJV's operational commercial properties (figures not proportioned with MAS' ordinary interest in DJV). As a


result, DJV benefited from a negligible LTV, as well as substantial secured debt capacity.


DJV OWNERSHIP OF MAS SHARES, MAS' FUNDING COMMITMENTS TO DJV


On 30 June 2025, PKI owned 153,498,569 MAS shares. After the financial year end, on 4 August 2025, PKI launched its Voluntary


Bid to acquire all shares in MAS, which closed on 14 August 2025. As referred to in MAS' SENS announcement on 15 August 2025,


following settlement of the acceptances by MAS Shareholders, (i) PKI holds 254,093,543 MAS shares, being 36.32% of the issued


share capital of MAS (excluding treasury shares); and (ii) PKI, together with other shareholders deemed to be concert parties


under Maltese listings requirements, in aggregate hold 49.4% of the issued share capital of MAS.


By 30 June 2025, MAS had invested EUR470million in preferred equity and had no ongoing undrawn commitment to


invest in DJV preferred equity. The Group has a requirement to provide DJV with a EUR30million revolving credit facility,


which was undrawn on 30 June 2025.


OPERATIONS


Information regarding MAS' Central and Eastern European directly owned assets' LFL footfall and tenants' sales


(compared to the same period in 2024) and collection rates for the six months to 30 June 2025 is detailed in Table 3


and does not include operational information in respect of properties owned by the DJV. All figures were reported


on 26 August 2025.

Consumption in all Central and Eastern European countries where the Group operates continued its growth trend.


Trading and footfall were robust in all Group properties throughout the six months to 30 June 2025. Occupancy


cost ratios were a healthy 10.8% (excluding certain tenant categories: supermarkets, DIY stores, entertainment and


services; 10.9% on 30 June 2024). Collection rates were excellent, and occupancy of Central and Eastern European


directly-owned retail assets improved to 97.9% on 30 June 2025 (97.5% on 30 June 2024).


During this period, on a LFL basis, Central and Eastern European tenants' sales were outstanding, and both open-


air malls and enclosed malls outperformed the same six-month period in 2024 (8% and 4%, respectively). Notable


outperformance of the aggregate was achieved by toys, entertainment, home furnishings, shoes and health and


beauty tenant categories. Pet shop and services categories have, however, performed less admirably.


LFL Passing NRI of the Group's directly-owned properties in CEE increased by 6.6% year-on-year, which is attributable


to rent indexation, rental from overage as well as outstanding rent reversions during the period.


Trading in DJV's operational retail properties, managed by MAS' asset management team, was exceptional during


the six months to 30 June 2025. LFL footfall and tenants' sales improved by 3% and 15%, respectively, compared to


the same six-month period in 2024. Similarly to MAS' directly-owned assets, collection rates were outstanding at


99.4%. As a result of DJV's largest retail development to date, Mall Moldova, becoming operational in April 2025,


occupancy in DJV's operational retail properties decreased slightly to 96.1% on 30 June 2025 (96.9% on 30 June


2024). Nevertheless, the occupancy cost ratio was outstanding, at 7.9% (excluding certain tenant categories:


supermarkets, DIY stores, entertainment and services).


PROPERTY VALUATIONS


The overall EUR57.2million income property fair value uplift was the result of positive fair value adjustments of


EUR64.6million to directly-owned income property in CEE (LFL improvement of 7.3% compared to valuations on 30 June


2024) and a decrease of EUR7.4million in WE (11.9% decrease compared to valuations on 30 June 2024, partially due to


an increase in the valuation discount rate, and partially due to reduced growth prospects for Flensburg Galerie).


The valuation of MAS' (and DJV's) properties is determined biannually by external, independent professional valuers,


with appropriate, recognised qualifications and recent experience in the relevant location and property category.


Valuations are primarily based on discounted forecasted cash flows and are therefore forward-looking. Compared


to valuations on 30 June 2024, the weighted average unlevered discount rate for directly-owned income property


in CEE decreased from 9.53% to 9.43%.


ASSET DISPOSALS


During the financial year to 30 June 2025, MAS disposed of its Strip Mall assets located in Focsani, Slobozia, Ramnicu


Sarat, Sebes, Targu Secuiesc, Fagaras and Gheorgheni in December 2024 at a price above the Strip Malls' book


values on 30 June 2024. The Group, as well as DJV, which joined the transaction for the sale of the Slobozia Value


Centre Extension, completed the transaction and collected the proceeds on 31 January 2025.


The Company also identified certain properties, as part of MAS' strategy to efficiently recycle and re-allocate capital,


which were designated as non-core, and marked as potential future disposals. Some of these assets also currently


meet the classification requirements to be considered as 'held for sale' in compliance with strict IFRS standards.


As a result, the Flensburg Galerie (Germany) and Nova Park (Poland) assets have been reclassified as such in MAS'


consolidated annual financial statements for the financial year to 30 June 2025. These properties are individual


assets in countries where the Group has limited operational presence and narrow growth prospects and will be


disposed of in due course. With respect to the disposal process of Flensburg Galerie, management's estimate for


disposal realisation costs and losses, based on expected sale proceeds, was reinstated as an adjustment in the


Group's segmental reporting on a proportionate consolidation basis and amounts to EUR16.1million.


DJV DEVELOPMENTS


Construction at Mall Moldova, Iasi, owned by the DJV, was finalised as scheduled, and the centre opened on


17 April 2025. It is Romania's second super-regional enclosed mall and retail node, and the only one of this magnitude


outside of Bucharest. This is the largest shopping destination in the Moldova region, bringing in the Eastern part of


the country over 250 national and international retail brands, of which 50 are exclusive. Occupancy at opening was


over 94% of the centre's 87,100m2 GLA, part of a 110,400m2 retail destination, and footfall and tenants' sales since


then were exceptional.


PROSPECTS AND DIVIDEND


MAS suspended dividend payments from August 2023 to accumulate liquidity and strengthen its capital position in a


challenging macroeconomic environment, which adversely impacted access to, and cost of, unsecured funding for high-yield


real estate issuers. Absent proceeds from distributions by DJV, asset sales, or additional debt and/or equity raisings,


MAS faces a projected liquidity shortfall of approximately EUR50million to 30 June 2026, notwithstanding the substantial


senior secured debt already raised or in the process of being raised.


With respect to potential distributions by DJV, MAS has taken note of PKI's announcement regarding the outcome


of the voluntary bid, which referred to DJV's intention to make a special distribution to support MAS in reinstating


dividend payments from September 2025.


DJV is currently reviewing both its own and MAS' liquidity positions to determine the appropriate level of distribution


that could contribute to addressing MAS' liquidity shortfall while meeting DJV's own requirements (2). To the extent that


such a distribution satisfactorily addresses MAS' liquidity needs, the Board remains firmly committed to resuming dividend


payments at a sustainable pay-out ratio over the medium to long-term, subject to the absence of unforeseen circumstances


and provided that such payments are consistent with the relative attractiveness of investment opportunities available at


the time, capital resources are sufficient to cover its funding commitments and the Company's long-term objectives,


including self-imposed gearing limitations, are not placed at undue risk.


EARNINGS GUIDANCE


Earnings guidance, and if appropriate information regarding the resumption of dividends, for the 2026 financial year, will be


provided after clarity has been received regarding DJV's distributions.

(1) DJV is an abbreviation for a separate corporate entity named PKM Development Ltd (PKM Development), an associate of MAS since 2016


    with independent governance. MAS owns 40% of PKM Development's ordinary equity (EUR20million), an investment conditional on it


    irrevocably undertaking to provide preferred equity to PKM Development on notice of drawdown. By 30 June 2025, MAS had invested


    EUR470million in preferred equity and had no ongoing undrawn commitment to invest in DJV preferred equity. In addition, MAS has


    committed to provide PKM Development a revolving credit facility of EUR30million at a 7.5% fixed rate, which was undrawn on 30 June 2025


    (figures not proportionally consolidated). The balance of the ordinary equity in PKM Development (EUR30million) was taken up by


    Prime Kapital in 2016 in cash. In terms of applicable contractual undertakings and restrictions, Prime Kapital:


(i)   is not permitted to undertake real estate development in CEE outside of PKM Development until the DJV's capital commitments are


      fully drawn and invested or 2030 (end of exclusivity period);


(ii)  contributes secured development pipeline to PKM Development at cost;


(iii) takes responsibility for sourcing further developments, and


(iv)  provides PKM Development with all necessary construction and development services via its integrated in-house platform.


(2) Access to information on MAS  financial performance for the 2025 financial year was equally restricted to PKI and DJV, as was the


    case for all shareholders, due to MAS  information management processes. Consequently, DJV was not in a position to finalise its


    analysis before the release of MAS  2025 financial year results.
