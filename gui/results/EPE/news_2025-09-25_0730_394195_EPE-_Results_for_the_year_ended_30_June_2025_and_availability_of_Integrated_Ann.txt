Results for the year ended 30 June 2025 and availability of Integrated Annual Report and B-BBEE Compliance Report

ANNUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2025 AND AVAILABILITY OF INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT AND B-BBEE COMPLIANCE REPORT




INTRODUCTION




EPE Capital Partners Ltd is an investment holding company, registered, and incorporated in Mauritius and listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange ("JSE").


It invested directly into Funds or Co-Investments that are actively managed by Rohatyn Management South Africa (Pty) Limited ("TRG SA"), that provided the


Company with largely indirect exposure to a portfolio of unlisted private equity-type investments ("Portfolio Companies"). In addition, TRG SA acts as the


Company's Investment Advisor.




Due to the nature of the business conducted by the Group, the Group's performance is measured by growth in the net asset value ("NAV") and NAV per share


("NAVPS"). NAVPS has been adopted as the relevant measure for trading statement and results announcement purposes. This approach is consistent with prior


years and has been approved by the JSE.




The NAV of each Fund is derived from the fair values of the underlying Portfolio Companies which are prepared in accordance with International Private


Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines, and consists of investments being valued on an earnings or revenue multiple method. In terms of this


method, an appropriate valuation multiple, as derived from public market companies' multiples and adjusted by the investment manager for certain factors, is


applied to an investment's maintainable earnings (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation ("EBITDA")) or revenue to determine


the enterprise value of the investment that is then adjusted for surplus assets or net debt to derive the equity value of the investment attributable to its


shareholders.

Overview




The past year has been defined by strong delivery against our stated objectives, with tangible outcomes across both our unlisted and listed portfolios. The


combination of disciplined portfolio management, successful realisations, and return of capital to shareholders translated into material value creation.




The Ethos Capital adjusted NAVPS increased from R6.58 at 30 June 2024 (on a like-for-like comparison, excluding the unbundled Brait ordinary shares) to


R8.57 at 30 June 2025, representing a 30% return.




This was largely driven by the unlisted portfolio that achieved a pleasing gross return of 31%, with reported last-12-months ("LTM") sales and EBITDA of the


unlisted Portfolio Companies increasing by 38% and 40% respectively. The main contributor of the growth was Optasia, the Company's largest investment at


over 50% of total assets, that grew its LTM EBITDA by 55%. Further notable increases were achieved from Vertice, e4 and Primedia.




The listed portfolio returned 36% over the year, resulting from increases in the values of the Brait exchangeable bonds, as well as a significant increase


in the investment in MTN Zakhele Futhi that was largely realised in cash post the year-end.




The NAVPS is after providing for the performance participation payable to the Investment Advisor for the 3-year measurement period ended 30 June 2025. This


relates to the incentive scheme, implemented at the Ethos Capital listing, that entitles the Investment Advisor to a share of the growth in the portfolio in


excess of an average 10% growth over each measurement period.




During the year, nearly R606 million of proceeds were distributed by the TRG Funds to Ethos Capital, that included the realisation proceeds from Synerlytic


in August 2024 and a partial realisation of Optasia in April 2025, at a significant premium to the 30 June 2024 carrying value.  The proceeds were used to


reduce the Group's debt by R440 million to R82 million at 30 June 2025.




The proceeds also enabled share repurchases during the year, totalling R27 million. In April 2025, The Board approved a further share buyback programme of


R40 million, of which R2 million has been completed to date. The intention is to resume the repurchase program post the closed period.




The Ethos Capital share price grew by 58% over the year to R6.65 at 30 June 2025, with the share price discount to NAVPS reducing to 22% (30 June 2024:


40%).




In July 2024, the Company unbundled its investment in the Brait ordinary shares for R121 million.  The unbundling was followed by the Brait rights issue,


that the shareholders were entitled to participate in at a price of R0.59 per Brait ordinary share. Subsequent to the unbundling, the Brait share price


increased to R2.23 at 30 June 2025; an increase of 137% over the unbundled price and 278% over the rights issue price. On the assumption that the Ethos


Capital shareholders exercised the underlying rights and remained invested in these rights and unbundled ordinary shares at 30 June 2025, the implied growth


in NAVPS would have been 61%.




The Board  approved the unbundling of the Brait exchangeable bonds (R175.5 million at 30 June 2025) to Ethos Capital shareholders that should conclude in


November 2025, subject to exchange control approvals. Further details will be provided via the stock exchange news service in due course.




The Board remains committed to maximise value from the remaining portfolio and return capital to shareholders in a responsible and efficient manner.

UPDATE ON THE INVESTMENT ADVISOR




The Rohatyn Group ("TRG"), a global private markets asset manager focussed on emerging markets and real assets, acquired the business of Ethos Private Equity


("Ethos") in 2023 to leverage Ethos' presence in the African market and to expand Ethos' multi-asset-class capabilities across emerging markets. TRG SA became


the Company's Investment Advisor as note above. However, market dynamics have changed and, over the past two years, capital allocators to African private markets


have exhibited a strong preference for niche, geographically specialised firms with independent and localized corporate infrastructure. As a result, Ethos and


TRG decided that the team would be better positioned as an independent business and the partners in the Africa business have agreed to acquire TRG SA and


reestablish it under the Ethos brand. This transaction remains subject to certain closing conditions and is expected to be completed in October 2025.
