UNBUNDLING BY ETHOS CAPITAL OF THE BRAIT EXCHANGEABLE BONDS: CLOSING PRICES


OF THE BRAIT EXCHANGEABLE BONDS AND ETHOS CAPITAL A ORDINARY SHARES ON THE


RECORD DATE




PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT NOTE AT THE END OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT




1.    Shareholders of Ethos Capital ("Ethos Capital Shareholders") are referred to various


      announcements released by the Company on the Stock Exchange News Service operated by


      JSE Limited ("SENS") relating to the unbundling by Ethos Capital of its remaining investment


      in Brait plc ("Brait"), comprising of the senior unsecured exchangeable registered bonds held


      in Brait Investment Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Brait (the "Brait Bonds") to


      Ethos Capital Shareholders (the "2025 Brait Unbundling").




2.    In accordance with the JSE Corporate Actions Timetable, the Company hereby advises Ethos


      Capital Shareholders that today, 5 December 2025, being the record date for the 2025 Brait


      Unbundling (the "Record Date"), the JSE closing price of the:




2.1         Brait Bonds amounted to 77,520.0 cents (i.e. R775.20) per bond; and




2.2         Ethos Capital A Ordinary shares (the "Ethos Capital Shares") amounted to 690.0 cents


            (i.e. R6.90) per share.




3.    The apportionment ratio of each Ethos Capital shareholder's current base cost is therefore


      8.81064% to the Brait Bonds and 91.18936% to the Ethos Capital Shares.




4.    As outlined in the announcement issued by the Company on Thursday, 4 December 2025, for


      South African tax purposes the base cost of each Ethos Capital Share must therefore be


      reduced by 66.66720 cents (i.e. R0.66667). This amount is calculated based on the distribution


      ratio of 0.00086 multiplied by the closing price of the Brait Bonds of 77,520.0 cents (i.e.


      R775.20) on the Record Date.
