VOLUNTARY NAV, NAVPS AND CAUTIONARY UPDATE, PROCEEDINGS AT THE AGM


AND DECLARATION OF BRAIT EXCHANGEABLE BONDS UNBUNDLING




THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS


RESTRICTED AND IS NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION,


DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN OR INTO CANADA OR ANY


OTHER STATE OR JURISDICTION IN WHICH SUCH RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR


DISTRIBUTION WOULD BE UNLAWFUL




Ethos Capital is an investment holding company, registered, and incorporated in Mauritius. It is listed


on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange ("JSE") and offers shareholders potential long-term capital


appreciation through investments into Funds or co-investments that are actively managed by Ethos


Private Equity ("Ethos"), providing the Company with exposure to a diversified portfolio of unlisted


private equity type investments




The performance is largely measured by the growth in the Net Asset Value ("NAV") and NAV per


share ("NAVPS") of the Company and the Ethos Capital Board of Directors has adopted the NAVPS


as the relevant measure for trading statement purposes.




Below is a voluntary update of the Group since the annual results announcement published on the


Stock Exchange News Service ("SENS") in September 2025.




Voluntary NAV and NAVPS update




30 September 2025 update




The NAVPS of the Group at 30 September 2025 increased by 3.9% to R8.90, compared to the NAVPS


at 30 June 2025 of R8.57.




An analysis of the movements in the Group's NAV and NAVPS over the 3-month period is detailed


below:






 R' million                                                At 30 June 2025   At 30 Sept 2025


 Optasia                                                             1,214             1,310


 Brait Exchangeable Bonds                                              176               169


 Realised asset (MTN ZF)                                                47                 7


 Realised asset (iKhokha)                                               53                41


 Residual Assets (Other unlisted portfolio assets)                     881               901


 Total assets                                                        2,371             2,428


 Net (debt) / cash                                                   (177)             (149)


 Net asset value                                                     2,194             2,279





 NAVPS ? Rand                                                         8.57              8.90




The increase in NAVPS was largely attributable to unrealised revaluation gains on Optasia, resulting


from further growth in its EBITDA of nearly 11% over the quarter, that was partially offset by the


weakening of the US$:ZAR exchange rate. The valuation, conducted prior to Optasia's listing,


implied a share price of R17.33 (relative to the listing price of R19.00 and current share price of


R19.80).




The price of the Brait Exchangeable Bonds decreased by 3.8% to R760 as at 30 September 2025.


The realisations of MTN Zakhele Futhi ("MTN ZF") and iKhokha were noted in the 30 June 2025


annual results announcement, with Ethos Capital receiving the initial R42.6 million in proceeds from


MTN ZF during September 2025 (with a further R6.7 million expected before the end of the year).


Crossfin made the decision to retain a portion of the iKhokha proceeds to partially settle its group


debt. This contributed to growth in the value of the Residual Assets and decreased the distributed


proceeds (from the iKhokha sale) to Ethos Capital by R11.7 million.




The Residual Assets increased by 2.2% over the quarter from R881 million to R901 million. On a like-


for-like basis, these assets grew from R881 million to R889 million with an additional R11.7 million


uplift in value to R901 million due to the reduction in the Crossfin debt. There were mixed


performances across the portfolio with the largest positive NAV contribution from Vertice, that grew


its maintainable EBITDA by over 6% and resulted in a R24.9 million increase in NAV (to R255.9


million), and e4, which increased the NAV by R7.2 million. The decreases to the September NAV


were largely as a result of reductions in Echo and Eazi Group.




Optasia IPO and sell-down




As announced by the Company on SENS on 3 November 2025, Optasia successfully completed its


Initial Public Offering ("IPO") and listed its shares on the JSE on 4 November 2025 at a listing price


of R19.00, that reflects a 17% premium to the NAV of Optasia in Ethos Capital's 30 June 2025 results


(and c.10% premium to the 30 September 2025 valuation).




As part of the listing, the Ethos Optasia Consortium SPV (the special purpose vehicle which holds


Ethos Capital's indirect interests in Optasia that it holds via Ethos funds) sold 26.4% of its shares at


the listing price. As a result, Ethos Capital's indirect interest in Optasia reduced from 6.5% to 4.5%


and R339 million of net proceeds will flow (after the Company's pro-rata share of fees and


withholding taxes ("WHT")). The WHT can be offset against the Company's future income tax


liabilities.




Below is a summary of changes to the Group's adjusted NAV and NAVPS since 30 September 2025,


which incorporates the impact of the Optasia IPO, the realisation of the Company's indirect Optasia


stake, and current listed asset valuations.






 R' million                                             At 30 Sept 2025   Current at 17 Nov 2025


 Optasia                                                          1,310                    1,097


 Brait Exchangeable Bonds                                           169                      172


 Realised asset (MTN ZF)                                              7                        7


 Realised asset (iKhokha)                                            41                       41


 Residual Assets (Other unlisted portfolio assets)                  901                      901


 Total assets                                                     2,428                    2,218


 Net (debt) / cash (1)                                            (149)                      190


 Net asset value                                                  2,279                    2,408


 NAVPS ? Rand                                                      8.90                     9.41


 (1) Net debt decreased to net cash post IPO proceeds






The adjusted NAVPS of R9.41 represents a 9.8% increase over Ethos Capital's 30 June 2025 NAVPS


of R8.57, principally driven by the valuation increase of Optasia which increased to R19.80 as at 17


November 2025.




Cautionary update


Further to the cautionary announcement published on SENS on 3 November 2025 where the


Company had announced that it had received an unsolicited Non-Binding Offer ("NBO") to acquire


the Company's Residual Assets, Ethos Capital shareholders are advised that the engagement on the


NBO remains ongoing.




Ethos Capital shareholders are reminded to continue exercising caution when dealing in the


Company's securities until a further announcement is made.

Unbundling of Brait Exchangeable Bonds




Following the confirmation of approval for the unbundling of the Brait Exchangeable Bonds from the


Financial Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank, the Ethos Capital Board of


Directors has approved the unbundling of the Brait Exchangeable Bonds. Further details in relation


to the process and implementation timetable are noted below in the Declaration announcement.


Declaration announcement: Unbundling by Ethos Capital of the Brait Bonds (as defined below)




1.      INTRODUCTION




1.1         Shareholders of Ethos Capital ("Ethos Capital Shareholders") are referred to the


            announcements released by the Company on SENS on 13 November 2023,


            24 June 2024, 25 September 2025 and 3 November 2025, respectively wherein Ethos


            Capital Shareholders were advised that:




1.1.1             the Ethos Capital board of directors (the "Board") had decided to focus on


                  winding down Ethos Capital by divesting of its asset base in an orderly manner


                  whilst making no new capital investments and had accordingly been involved in


                  discussions with Ethos Capital Shareholders regarding a number of options to


                  unlock value for the Ethos Capital Shareholders (the "Divestiture Plans");




1.1.2             consequently in June 2024, the Board decided to progress its Divestiture Plans


                  by unbundling a portion of its investment in Brait PLC ("Brait"), comprising of all


                  of the Brait ordinary shares, held indirectly by Ethos Capital through the Ethos


                  Direct Investments Fund and Ethos Fund VII (together, the "Funds"), to Ethos


                  Capital Shareholders (the "2024 Brait Unbundling");




1.1.3             following the implementation of the 2024 Brait Unbundling and in furtherance of


                  the objectives set out in its Divestiture Plans, the Board decided (based on the


                  recommendation of the Investment Advisor) to unbundle the remaining portion


                  of its investment in Brait, comprising of the senior unsecured exchangeable


                  registered bonds, held indirectly by Ethos Capital through the Funds, in Brait


                  Investment Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Brait ("BIH"), on behalf


                  of Ethos Capital as a limited partner (the "Brait Bonds") to Ethos Capital


                  Shareholders (the "2025 Brait Unbundling"); and




1.1.4             the Board expects to implement the 2025 Brait Unbundling as soon possible this


                  year, following receipt of the requisite confirmation or approval of the Financial


                  Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank (the "FinSurv


                  Approval").




1.2         Accordingly, Ethos Capital Shareholders are hereby advised that:




1.2.1             the FinSurv Approval was received on Tuesday, 11 November 2025; and




1.2.2             accordingly, the Board has (based on the recommendation of the Investment


                  Advisor) resolved to implement the 2025 Brait Unbundling in accordance with the


                  terms set out in this declaration announcement.




2.      THE 2025 BRAIT UNBUNDLING




2.1         The 2025 Brait Unbundling will be implemented as a capital distribution in specie to


            Ethos Capital Shareholders of, in aggregate, 222 204 Brait Bonds (valued at R175.5


            million as at 30 June 2025), each with a nominal value of R750 (R250 per bond capital


            repayment made in August 2024) and maturing on 3 December 2027, and will result in


            Ethos Capital distributing 0.00086 Brait Bonds (under JSE alpha code BIHLEB and ISIN


            MU0707E00002), for every 1 Ethos Capital A ordinary share ("Ethos Capital Share")


            held by Ethos Capital Shareholders recorded in the register on the record date,


            currently expected to be Friday, 5 December 2025.


2.2         Ethos Capital Shareholders who transfer or dispose of their Ethos Capital Shares prior


            to the last day to trade in Ethos Capital Shares in order to be eligible to participate in


            the 2025 Brait Unbundling, currently expected to be Tuesday, 2 December 2025, will


            not participate in the 2025 Brait Unbundling and will not receive the Brait Bonds.




2.3         The 2025 Brait Unbundling will not involve an election on the part of Ethos Capital


            Shareholders and, accordingly, no Ethos Capital Shareholders shall be entitled to elect


            to receive cash in lieu of their entitlement to receive the Brait Bonds in terms of the 2025


            Brait Unbundling.




3.      SALIENT DATES AND TIMES




        The following are the indicative dates and times that apply to the 2025 Brait Unbundling:

        entitlements to the Brait Bonds expected to be made, on




        Notes:




        1.    The above dates and times are subject to change and/or amendment at the discretion


              of Ethos Capital, subject to the approval of the JSE, if required. Any such amendment


              will be published on SENS.

              not be dematerialised or re-materialised between Wednesday, 3 December 2025


              and Friday, 5 December 2025, both days inclusive.






4.      FRACTIONAL ENTITLEMENTS




4.1          The distribution of the Brait Bonds to Ethos Capital Shareholders in accordance with the


             distribution entitlement ratio set out above, could result in fractional entitlements for


             such Ethos Capital Shareholders. Such fractional entitlements will be rounded down to


             the nearest whole number and aggregated. The aggregated excess fractional


             entitlements to the Brait Bonds to which Ethos Capital Shareholders would otherwise


             be entitled will not be transferred to Ethos Capital Shareholders, but will instead be sold


             on behalf of and at the risk of the relevant Ethos Capital Shareholders in the market as


             soon as practicable following the implementation of the 2025 Brait Unbundling. Ethos


             Capital Shareholders will accordingly be paid the cash in respect of the fractional


             entitlements to the unbundled Brait Bonds, on the basis outlined below.




4.2          In accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements, this amount will be determined with


             reference to the volume weighted average price of the Brait Bonds traded on the JSE


             on Wednesday, 3 December 2025, being the first trading day "ex" the entitlement to


             participate in the 2025 Brait Unbundling, reduced by 10% ("Cash Proceeds"). The Cash


             Proceeds will be paid into the accounts of the relevant Ethos Capital Shareholders held


             with their Central Securities Depositary Participant or broker.




4.3          The cash value to be used to calculate the Cash Proceeds in respect of fractional


             entitlements will be announced before 11h00 (SAST) on Thursday, 4 December 2025,


             in accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements.




5.      TAXATION




5.1          The 2025 Brait Unbundling constitutes a return of capital by Ethos Capital (a company


             incorporated and tax resident in, and subject to, the laws of the Republic of Mauritius)


             to the Ethos Capital Shareholders, and therefore South African dividend withholding tax


             is not applicable.




             South African tax




5.2          South Africa has a residence-based system of taxation. Tax residents of South Africa are


             taxed on their worldwide income, whereas non-South African tax residents are taxed


             only on income and certain capital gains sourced in South Africa or deemed to be from


             a source in South Africa.




5.3          An individual will be a resident of South Africa for tax purposes if:




5.3.1             such individual is "ordinarily resident" in South Africa. This term is not defined in


                  the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 ("Income Tax Act") and therefore its meaning is


                  determined according to guidelines established by the courts. Generally, a


                  person's ordinary residence will be "the country to which he would naturally and


                  as a matter of course return from his wanderings; as contrasted with other lands it


                  might be called his usual or principal residence and it would be described more


                  aptly than other countries as his real home"; or




5.3.2             the requirements of the physical presence test are met. This is determined with


                  reference to the number of days spent by the individual in South Africa over a


                  successive six-year period. In order to trigger tax residency, the person must be


                  physically present in South Africa for more than 91 days in aggregate during the


                  relevant year of assessment as well as for more than 91 days in aggregate during


                  each of the five years of assessment preceding such year of assessment. In


                  addition, the person must have been physically present in South Africa for more


                  than 915 days in aggregate during those five preceding years of assessment. If


                  the person is physically outside South Africa for a continuous period of at least


                  330 full days, the person will be deemed not to be a resident from the day on


                  which the person so ceased to be physically present in South Africa.




5.4          As regards legal persons, a resident is defined in the Income Tax Act as any person


             which is incorporated, established or formed in South Africa or which has its place of


             effective management in South Africa. "Place of effective management" is not a defined


             concept. However, reference can be made to "Income Tax Interpretation Note 6?


             Resident: Place of Effective Management" which details the approach that may be


             adopted by the South African Revenue Service to the interpretation of the concept.


             Accordingly, a company's "place of effective management" is the place where key


             management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of its


             business as a whole are in substance made. This interpretation is consistent with the


             Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) commentary on


             the term.




5.5          For South African tax purposes, the 2025 Brait Unbundling will comprise a foreign return


             of capital as defined in section 1 of the Income Tax Act and as such, no South African


             dividend tax arises.




5.6          Ethos Capital Shareholders that are subject to South African capital gains tax must, in


             accordance with paragraph 76B(2) of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, reduce


             the tax base cost of their Ethos Capital Shares, in respect of which the distribution is


             made, by the amount of the distribution. To the extent the distribution exceeds the tax


             base ding down Ethos Capital by divesting of its asset base in an orderly manner


                  whilst making no new capital investments and had accordingly been involved in


                  discussions with Ethos Capital Shareholders regarding a number of options to


                  unlock value for the Ethos Capital Shareholders (the "Divestiture Plans");




1.1.2             consequently in June 2024, the Board decided to progress its Divestiture Plans


                  by unbundling a portion of its investment in Brait PLC ("Brait"), comprising of all


                  of the Brait ordinary shares, held indirectly by Ethos Capital through the Ethos


                  Direct Investments Fund and Ethos Fund VII (together, the "Funds"), to Ethos


                  Capital Shareholders (the "2024 Brait Unbundling");




1.1.3             following the implementation of the 2024 Brait Unbundling and in furtherance of


                  the objectives set out in its Divestiture Plans, the Board decided (based on the


                  recommendation of the Investment Advisor) to unbundle the remaining portion


                  of its investment in Brait, comprising of the senior unsecured exchangeable


                  registered bonds, held indirectly by Ethos Capital through the Funds, in Brait


                  Investment Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Brait ("BIH"), on behalf


                  of Ethos Capital as a limited partner (the "Brait Bonds") to Ethos Capital


                  Shareholders (the "2025 Brait Unbundling"); and




1.1.4             the Board expects to implement the 2025 Brait Unbundling as soon possible this


                  year, following receipt of the requisite confirmation or approval of the Financial


                  Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank (the "FinSurv


                  Approval").




1.2         Accordingly, Ethos Capital Shareholders are hereby advised that:




1.2.1             the FinSurv Approval was received on Tuesday, 11 November 2025; and




1.2.2             accordingly, the Board has (based on the recommendation of the Investment


                  Advisor) resolved to implement the 2025 Brait Unbundling in accordance with the


                  terms set out in this declaration announcement.




2.      THE 2025 BRAIT UNBUNDLING




2.1         The 2025 Brait Unbundling will be implemented as a capital distribution in specie to


            Ethos Capital Shareholders of, in aggregate, 222 204 Brait Bonds (valued at R175.5


            million as at 30 June 2025), each with a nominal value of R750 (R250 per bond capital


            repayment made in August 2024) and maturing on 3 December 2027, and will result in


            Ethos Capital distributing 0.00086 Brait Bonds (under JSE alpha code BIHLEB and ISIN


            MU0707E00002), for every 1 Ethos Capital A ordinary share ("Ethos Capital Share")


            held by Ethos Capital Shareholders recorded in the register on the record date,


            currently expected to be Friday, 5 December 2025.


2.2         Ethos Capital Shareholders who transfer or dispose of their Ethos Capital Shares prior


            to the last day to trade in Ethos Capital Shares in order to be eligible to participate in


            the 2025 Brait Unbundling, currently expected to be Tuesday, 2 December 2025, will


            not participate in the 2025 Brait Unbundling and will not receive the Brait Bonds.




2.3         The 2025 Brait Unbundling will not involve an election on the part of Ethos Capital


            Shareholders and, accordingly, no Ethos Capital Shareholders shall be entitled to elect


            to receive cash in lieu of their entitlement to receive the Brait Bonds in terms of the 2025


            Brait Unbundling.

4.      FRACTIONAL ENTITLEMENTS




4.1          The distribution of the Brait Bonds to Ethos Capital Shareholders in accordance with the


             distribution entitlement ratio set out above, could result in fractional entitlements for


             such Ethos Capital Shareholders. Such fractional entitlements will be rounded down to


             the nearest whole number and aggregated. The aggregated excess fractional


             entitlements to the Brait Bonds to which Ethos Capital Shareholders would otherwise


             be entitled will not be transferred to Ethos Capital Shareholders, but will instead be sold


             on behalf of and at the risk of the relevant Ethos Capital Shareholders in the market as


             soon as practicable following the implementation of the 2025 Brait Unbundling. Ethos


             Capital Shareholders will accordingly be paid the cash in respect of the fractional


             entitlements to the unbundled Brait Bonds, on the basis outlined below.




4.2          In accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements, this amount will be determined with


             reference to the volume weighted average price of the Brait Bonds traded on the JSE


             on Wednesday, 3 December 2025, being the first trading day "ex" the entitlement to


             participate in the 2025 Brait Unbundling, reduced by 10% ("Cash Proceeds"). The Cash


             Proceeds will be paid into the accounts of the relevant Ethos Capital Shareholders held


             with their Central Securities Depositary Participant or broker.




4.3          The cash value to be used to calculate the Cash Proceeds in respect of fractional


             entitlements will be announced before 11h00 (SAST) on Thursday, 4 December 2025,


             in accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements.




5.      TAXATION




5.1          The 2025 Brait Unbundling constitutes a return of capital by Ethos Capital (a company


             incorporated and tax resident in, and subject to, the laws of the Republic of Mauritius)


             to the Ethos Capital Shareholders, and therefore South African dividend withholding tax


             is not applicable.




             South African tax




5.2          South Africa has a residence-based system of taxation. Tax residents of South Africa are


             taxed on their worldwide income, whereas non-South African tax residents are taxed


             only on income and certain capital gains sourced in South Africa or deemed to be from


             a source in South Africa.




5.3          An individual will be a resident of South Africa for tax purposes if:




5.3.1             such individual is "ordinarily resident" in South Africa. This term is not defined in


                  the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 ("Income Tax Act") and therefore its meaning is


                  determined according to guidelines established by the courts. Generally, a


                  person's ordinary residence will be "the country to which he would naturally and


                  as a matter of course return from his wanderings; as contrasted with other lands it


                  might be called his usual or principal residence and it would be described more


                  aptly than other countries as his real home"; or




5.3.2             the requirements of the physical presence test are met. This is determined with


                  reference to the number of days spent by the individual in South Africa over a


                  successive six-year period. In order to trigger tax residency, the person must be


                  physically present in South Africa for more than 91 days in aggregate during the


                  relevant year of assessment as well as for more than 91 days in aggregate during


                  each of the five years of assessment preceding such year of assessment. In


                  addition, the person must have been physically present in South Africa for more


                  than 915 days in aggregate during those five preceding years of assessment. If


                  the person is physically outside South Africa for a continuous period of at least


                  330 full days, the person will be deemed not to be a resident from the day on


                  which the person so ceased to be physically present in South Africa.




5.4          As regards legal persons, a resident is defined in the Income Tax Act as any person


             which is incorporated, established or formed in South Africa or which has its place of


             effective management in South Africa. "Place of effective management" is not a defined


             concept. However, reference can be made to "Income Tax Interpretation Note 6?


             Resident: Place of Effective Management" which details the approach that may be


             adopted by the South African Revenue Service to the interpretation of the concept.


             Accordingly, a company's "place of effective management" is the place where key


             management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of its


             business as a whole are in substance made. This interpretation is consistent with the


             Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) commentary on


             the term.




5.5          For South African tax purposes, the 2025 Brait Unbundling will comprise a foreign return


             of capital as defined in section 1 of the Income Tax Act and as such, no South African


             dividend tax arises.




5.6          Ethos Capital Shareholders that are subject to South African capital gains tax must, in


             accordance with paragraph 76B(2) of the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act, reduce


             the tax base cost of their Ethos Capital Shares, in respect of which the distribution is


             made, by the amount of the distribution. To the extent the distribution exceeds the tax


             base cost of the Ethos Capital Shares in the hands of such shareholders, a taxable gain


             may arise in accordance with paragraph 76B(3) of the Eighth Schedule to the Income


             Tax Act.




5.7          Ethos Capital will be deemed to have disposed of the Brait Bonds on the date of the


             distribution for an amount equal to the market value of the Brait Bonds, with the


             acquiring shareholders that are subject to South African capital gains deemed to have


             acquired the Brait Bonds at the date of distribution for expenditure equal to the market


             value of the Brait Bonds as dictated by paragraph 75 of the Eighth Schedule to the


             Income Tax Act.




5.8          Post the 2025 Brait Unbundling, South African tax resident shareholders not otherwise


             exempt from tax will be subject to income tax in respect of the bond interest on a yield


             to maturity basis. Provided that bond interest will not be attributable to a South African


             "permanent establishment" of non-South African tax resident bond holders, bond


             interest earned by non-South African tax resident bondholders should not be subject to


             any South African tax.




             Mauritian tax




5.9          Mauritius has a residence-based system of taxation. Tax residents of Mauritius are taxed


             on their worldwide income. However, for individuals, foreign source income is taxed on


             a remittance basis, meaning it is deemed to be derived when it is received in Mauritius


             or dealt with in Mauritius in the individual's interest. Non-Mauritian tax residents are


             taxed only on income sourced in Mauritius or deemed to be from a source in Mauritius.




5.10         An individual will be a resident of Mauritius for tax purposes if: (a) such individual has


             his domicile in Mauritius unless his permanent place of abode is outside Mauritius; (b)


             such individual has been present in Mauritius in that income year for a period of, or an


             aggregate period of, 183 days or more; or (c) such individual has been present in


             Mauritius in that income year and the 2 preceding income years for an aggregate period


             of 270 days or more.




5.11         As regards legal persons, a company will be a resident of Mauritius for tax purposes if it


             is incorporated in Mauritius or has its central management and control in Mauritius. A


             société will be a resident of Mauritius if it has its seat or siège in Mauritius and includes


             a société which has at least one associate or associé or gérant resident in Mauritius. A


             trust will be a resident of Mauritius if the trust is administered in Mauritius and a majority


             of the trustees are resident in Mauritius, or where the settlor of the trust was resident in


             Mauritius at the time the instrument creating the trust was executed. A Foundation will


             be a resident of Mauritius if it is registered in Mauritius or has its central management


             and control in Mauritius.




5.12         For Mauritius tax purposes, the 2025 Brait Unbundling constitutes a return of capital and


             does not constitute gross income under section 10 of the Mauritius Income Tax Act. As


             such, no Mauritius income tax or withholding tax arises on the distribution.




5.13         Mauritius does not impose capital gains tax. Accordingly, no Mauritius capital gains tax


             arises for Ethos Capital Shareholders on receipt of the Brait Bonds or on subsequent


             disposal of the Brait Bonds.




5.14         Interest income received by non-Mauritian tax resident bondholders from the Brait


             Bonds should be exempt from Mauritius income tax and withholding tax under item 4(a)


             of Sub-Part B of Part II of the Second Schedule to the Mauritius Income Tax Act, provided


             that (a) the bondholder is not carrying on any business in Mauritius; (b) the interest is


             not attributable to a Mauritius permanent establishment of the bondholder; and (c) the


             interest is paid by BIH out of its foreign source income. Given that BIH is a Mauritius


             Global Business Company and its income is foreign sourced, non-Mauritian tax resident


             bondholders should benefit from this exemption. Non-Mauritian tax resident


             bondholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding any obligations under the


             tax laws of their country of residence.




5.15         Interest income received by Mauritius tax resident bondholders from the Brait Bonds


             will constitute gross income and will be subject to Mauritius income tax at applicable


             rates. No withholding tax applies to interest paid to Mauritius tax resident companies as


             section 111B(a)(i) excludes such payments from the withholding tax regime. However,


             the interest income remains taxable at normal income tax rates applicable to the


             bondholder.




5.16         Ethos Capital Shareholders should obtain independent legal and other professional


             advice in relation to the tax treatment of the 2025 Brait Unbundling.

"likely", "should", "planned", "may", "estimated", "potential" or similar words and phrases. Examples


of forward-looking statements include statements regarding a future financial position. By their

cautions that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results,


financial and operating conditions, returns and the developments within the industries and markets


in which the Company invests may differ materially from those made in, or suggested by, the forward-

or combination of factors may cause actual results, performance, or achievement to differ materially


from those contained in any forward-looking statement is not known. The Company has no duty to,


and does not intend to, update, or revise the forward-looking statements contained in this
