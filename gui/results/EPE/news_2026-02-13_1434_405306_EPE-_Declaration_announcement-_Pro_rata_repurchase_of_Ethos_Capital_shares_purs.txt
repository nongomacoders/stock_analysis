EPE CAPITAL PARTNERS LTD


(Incorporated in the Republic of Mauritius)


(Registration number: C138883 C1/GBL)


ISIN: MU0522S00005


Share code: EPE


("Ethos Capital" or the "Company")




DECLARATION ANNOUNCEMENT: PRO RATA REPURCHASE OF ETHOS CAPITAL SHARES


PURSUANT TO THE REALISATION TRANSACTION




1. INTRODUCTION




   Shareholders of Ethos Capital ("Shareholders") are referred to the announcements released


   by the Company on the Stock Exchange News Service ("SENS") on 12 December 2025 and


   29 January 2026 (collectively, the "Previous Announcements"), whereby they were advised


   of, inter alia, the proposed transaction in terms of which the Company will dispose of the


   Residual Assets to the Investor Group (the "Transaction"), following which the Company


   would likely return capital to Shareholders by way of a Repurchase of Ethos Capital Shares


   (as defined below).




   As set out in the Previous Announcements, the Board confirms that it believes that the most


   appropriate mechanism to return the cash proceeds arising from the Transaction and the


   Company's available net cash raised from the Optasia Sell-down (as defined below) to all


   Shareholders, is by way of a pro rata repurchase of Ethos Capital Shares (as defined below)


   from all Shareholders.




   The purpose of this announcement is to provide Shareholders with further details regarding


   the implementation of the proposed Repurchase.




   Unless otherwise defined in this announcement, capitalised terms used herein have the


   meanings given to them in the Previous Announcements.




2. RATIONALE




   The purpose of the Repurchase is to return capital to all Shareholders pursuant to the


   implementation of the Transaction and the partial sell-down (the "Optasia Sell-down") of the


   ordinary shares that were indirectly held by Ethos Capital in Channel VAS Investments


   Limited t/a Optasia ("Optasia") as part of the listing and initial public offering of Optasia in


   November 2025 (the "Optasia Listing") as outlined in the Previous Announcements.




   Following the implementation of the Transaction, the Repurchase will be implemented in


   order to return the proceeds of the Transaction and the Optasia Sell-down to all Shareholders


   in line with their pro rata shareholding in the Company.




   The Board determined that the Repurchase is the most appropriate mechanism to facilitate


   all shareholders participating on a pro rata basis in the return of capital, having regard to a


   number of factors.




   As outlined in the Previous Announcements, the Company will retain its investment in


   Optasia following the sale of the Residual Assets under the Transaction, which holding is


   subject to a six-month lock-up post the Optasia Listing. Shareholders will be updated about


   any monetisation of the Optasia investment in future.




3. TERMS OF THE REPURCHASE




   The Company hereby makes the Repurchase offer to Shareholders on the terms and


   conditions set out in this announcement. The Repurchase will be funded out of the


   Company's net cash raised from the Optasia Sell-down and the proceeds arising from the


   Transaction.




   The Repurchase will be implemented as a return of capital to Shareholders by way of the pro


   rata repurchase of the issued A ordinary shares in the capital of the Company ("Ethos Capital


   Shares") from Shareholders based on 41.50000% of their shareholdings as of the record date


   (the "Repurchase Ratio"), at a price per Ethos Capital Share of 810.00 cents (R8.10) (the


   "Repurchase Consideration").




   The Repurchase Consideration is based on the latest estimate of the current net asset value


   per share ("NAVPS") of the Company, which has increased from the last reported estimate of


   R7.57 (as per SENS issued on 12 December 2025), with the increase being principally due to


   the increase in the Optasia share price.




   The total number of Ethos Capital Shares that are to be repurchased is expected to be


   106,233,958 Ethos Capital Shares, representing approximately 41.50000% of the Company's


   current issued share capital (excluding any A ordinary shares held in treasury).




   Accordingly, on this basis, the Company will return an aggregate amount of R860,495,060 to


   Shareholders through the Repurchase.




   Only whole numbers of Ethos Capital Shares will be repurchased. Where the Repurchase


   Ratio results in the Company becoming entitled to repurchase a fraction of an Ethos Capital


   Share, such fractional entitlement will be rounded down to the nearest whole number,


   resulting in only whole shares being repurchased.




   The Repurchase Consideration will be paid to each Shareholder, in full, in cash.




   All Ethos Capital Shares repurchased will be cancelled as issued shares and delisted from


   the JSE.




   Shareholders must instruct their Central Securities Depository Participant ("CSDP") or,


   broker or intermediary of their acceptance of the Repurchase in accordance with the custody


   agreement entered into with such intermediary. Shareholders who do not provide


   instructions to their CSDP or broker by 12:00 on Friday, 6 March 2026, will be deemed to have


   authorised their CSDP or broker, acting as their agent under the custody agreement, to accept


   the Repurchase on their behalf.




4. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO THE REPURCHASE




   The implementation of the Repurchase is subject to fulfilment or waiver of certain conditions


   precedent, including the receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals required for


   implementation of the Repurchase and the Transaction becoming unconditional by no later


   than 11:00 on Wednesday, 25 February 2026.
