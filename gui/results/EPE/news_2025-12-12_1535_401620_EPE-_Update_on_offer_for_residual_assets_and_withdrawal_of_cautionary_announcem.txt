UPDATE ON OFFER FOR RESIDUAL ASSETS AND WITHDRAWAL OF CAUTIONARY ANNOUNCEMENT




Ethos Capital is an investment holding company that is registered and incorporated in Mauritius, with its A


ordinary shares admitted to listing and trading on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange ("JSE"). Ethos Capital offers


shareholders potential long-term capital appreciation through investments into Funds or co-investments that are


actively managed by Ethos Management Company Proprietary Limited ("Ethos"), providing the Company with


exposure to a diversified portfolio of unlisted private equity type investments. Ethos is also the Investment


Advisor of the Company.




The Company's performance is largely measured by the growth in the Net Asset Value ("NAV") and NAV per share


("NAVPS") of the Company and the Ethos Capital Board of Directors (the "Board") has adopted the NAVPS as the


relevant measure for trading statement purposes.




The purpose of this announcement is to provide shareholders with an update following the announcements


published by the Company on the Stock Exchange News Service ("SENS") on 3 November and 18 November 2025.




OFFER FOR RESIDUAL ASSETS




As per the announcement published on SENS as noted above, the Board received an unsolicited Non-Binding


Offer ("NBO") from Rand Merchant Bank (a division of FirstRand Bank Limited) ("the Party"), as the lead investor


in a group of investors to be finalised ("the Investor Group"), to acquire the residual assets ("Residual Assets")


that Ethos Capital owns (the "Transaction") into a long term investment vehicle still to be established ("Bidco").


The Residual Assets to which the offer refers consists of all of the Company's remaining assets which is a portfolio


of unlisted assets (*) and excludes:




(i)   its interest in and exposure to Optasia, and


(ii)  the Brait Exchangeable Bonds (the "Brait Bonds") that were unbundled to Ethos Capital


      shareholders on 8 December 2025.




An update to the Company's NAV and NAVPS analysis as at 30 September 2025, after adjusting for the Optasia


proceeds from the initial public offering ("IPO"),and reflecting its valuation at the listing price of R19.00 per share,


proceeds from the realisations of MTN Zakele Futhi ("MTN ZF") and iKhokha and the unbundling of the Brait


Bonds, is provided below:

 (1) As announced on 18 November 2025




As an Investment Entity acting in accordance with its investment policy, there is no regulatory requirement for


Ethos Capital shareholder approval for the Transaction. The Board nonetheless elected to seek perspectives from


a range of Ethos Capital shareholders, including written feedback, received before coming to a final decision.




The Company solicited feedback from 82% of the Ethos Capital shareholders, excluding shares held by Ethos


executives and Ethos Capital non-executive Directors ("non-Ethos Shareholders"). 70% of the non-Ethos


Shareholders provided written support for the Transaction.




Following support from the majority of the shareholders, the Board, through its Investment Advisor, engaged


with the Party to finalise terms for the Transaction which resulted in an updated and improved offer ("Revised


Offer"). The key parameters of the Transaction are set out below.




Key terms of the Transaction




The Transaction values the Residual Assets at R640 million (that will be adjusted for any distributions from the


Residual Assets post 30 September 2025), which:




  ?  reflects a discount of 29% to the NAV of the Residual Assets of R901 million;


  ?  would, together with the remaining stake in Optasia and the net cash, result in a total aggregate value


     for the Ethos Capital assets of R7.57 per share; and


  ?  amounts to an effective premium of 10% to the Ethos Capital closing share price on 11 December 2025


     of R6.89 and a premium of 14% to the Ethos Capital share price (ex Brait Bonds) pre the 3 November


     2025 announcement.




In addition to the Transaction consideration above, the Party enhanced the original NBO terms for Ethos Capital


shareholders, with the following terms under the Revised Offer:




  ?  offered an earn-out for Ethos Capital shareholders of 50% of any incremental net equity proceeds


     received above the equity value reflected for the Vertice investment as at 30 September 2025 of R256


     million, until 30 June 2026. The exit process for Vertice has progressed well with an exit agreement


     signed on 8 December 2025, which would be subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions


     customary for a transaction of this nature. The completion date is expected to be on or around the end


     of April 2026; and


  ?  an option for Ethos Capital shareholders who are "Qualifying Shareholders" to reinvest their share of


     the Transaction proceeds received, pursuant to a distribution of the Transaction proceeds by Ethos


     Capital to its shareholders, into Bidco which will acquire the Residual Assets (the "Reinvestment


     Option"). Qualifying Shareholders include (i) a financial institution and other persons who are


     referred to in section 96(1) (a) of the South African Companies Act 71 of 2008 ("the Companies Act");


     and (ii) selected persons in South Africa in respect of whom the total contemplated investment cost


     for the reinvestment option is not less than R1 million per single addressee acting as principal. Further


     details of the Reinvestment Option will be provided to Ethos Capital shareholders in due course.




The Board has satisfied itself that there is sufficient funding for the implementation of the Transaction


("Funding").




Conditions precedent to the Transaction




The Transaction is subject to certain conditions which are customary for transactions of this nature including:




  ?  agreement on an optimal final proposed Funding and Transaction structure to the satisfaction of the


     Investor Group;


  ?  any proceeds or realisations received from the Residual Assets post 30 September 2025 will be adjusted


     for in the price offered for the Residual Assets;


  ?  an appropriate incentive mechanism being agreed with Ethos to manage the Residual Assets;


  ?  investment by key members of the Investment Advisor and certain non-executive Directors of Ethos


     Capital of no less than the net proceeds of the Transaction and, if required, a maximum of the value of


     their Ethos Capital shareholding;


  ?  the execution of relevant legal documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to the Investor Group,


     and these becoming unconditional to the satisfaction of the Investor Group; and


  ?  all requisite regulatory and other approvals and consents required for the implementation of the


     Transaction being obtained, including approval from the Financial Surveillance Department of the South


     African Reserve Bank.




The Transaction will become effective once the above conditions precedent have been fulfilled or waived, as


applicable.




Ethos Capital Board decision




Based on its own analysis and considering feedback shared by Ethos Capital shareholders over the past 24


months, the Board has been assessing a number of options to optimise the return of capital to Ethos Capital


shareholders and the ultimate realisation and wind down of the Company. Having concluded the unbundling of


the Brait Ordinary Shares, executed on the Optasia IPO and sell down, sold eight investments over the past three


years and the unbundling of the Brait Bonds that concluded today, the Board's view is that the realisation journey


has progressed well and that the valuation of the remaining parts within the Ethos Capital portfolio is more


transparent and quantifiable.




The Ethos Capital share price has appreciated from an equivalent low of R2.45 in June 2024 (R3.60 share price


adjusted for the unbundling of the Brait Ordinary Shares (July 2024) and Brait Bonds (December 2025)) to R6.89


as at 11 December 2025. Including the implied current market value of the Brait Ordinary Shares that were


distributed to Ethos Capital shareholders (currently valued at R2.68 per Ethos Capital share) and the value of the


recently unbundled Brait Bonds (R0.67 per Ethos Capital share), the aggregate would imply a price of R10.24 per


Ethos Capital share.




However, despite the interventions of the Board, post the listing of Optasia, the Residual Assets continue to trade


at a discount to NAV, which is likely to increase further as ongoing disposals impact the size, cost efficiency and


relevance of Ethos Capital as an Investment Holding company and in turn impact the valuation and liquidity for


Ethos Capital shareholders.




The Transaction would result in a number of cost savings for shareholders, namely:




?  the South African non-executive Directors have volunteered to decrease their combined Board fees by


   a further R1 million at the completion of the Transaction reflecting the fact that role of the Investment


   Committee will reduce based on the decrease in the Company's asset base;


?  management fees payable for the management of the Residual Assets of c.R14 million per annum; and


?  the performance participation that would be payable to the Ethos Private Equity Allocation Trust if the


   preferred returns are met, will be reduced as a result of the Residual Assets being sold at a discount to


   the 30 September 2025 NAV. The saving is estimated to be c.R50 million.




The Board reviewed the South African secondary market for private equity portfolios, including prevailing


liquidity, participant activity and discounts in general. Having considered all relevant factors, including the nature


of the remaining tail assets, the Board is satisfied that the Transaction delivers an optimal outcome for Ethos


Capital shareholders when compared with a prolonged run-down of the Residual Assets and the associated


economic and market risks over time.




Since the announcement of 3 November 2025, the Board has not received any other external interests for the


Residual Assets.




Post the sale of the Residual Assets, the Optasia investment would be optimally monetised over time after the


six-month lock up period post the Optasia listing.




For the purposes of this recommendation, the South African Directors, who are required by the Investor Group


to reinvest in the unlisted vehicle housing the Residual Assets, recused themselves from the Board decision.




Impact on Ethos Capital shareholders




The impact of the Transaction on the NAV and NAVPS to Ethos Capital shareholders is set out below:




 R' million                                                           Adjusted 30         Impact of Transaction

 NAVPS ? Rand                                                               8.59              7.57            7.57






Including the proceeds of the Transaction, it implies an expected current value to Ethos Capital shareholders of


R7.57 per Ethos Capital share (with continued exposure to the Optasia share price). This reflects a 12% discount


to the Adjusted NAVPS as detailed in the above table and as noted above, a 14% premium to the Ethos Capital


share price (ex Brait Bonds) on the day prior to the 3 November 2025 announcement.




Post the completion of the Transaction, Ethos Capital shareholders would be entitled to the following:




  ?  unrealised value of R4.11 per Ethos Capital share for the residual indirect stake in Optasia, based on its


     listing share price of R19.00 per share;


  ?  cash proceeds of R2.51 per Ethos Capital share from the disposal of the Residual Assets; and


  ?  net cash distribution of R0.95 per Ethos Capital share, largely resulting from the Optasia IPO sell-down.




The Board believes that the most appropriate mechanism to facilitate the cash distribution from the Transaction


and the current net cash would be a pro rata share repurchase from all Ethos Capital shareholders. Once the


transaction has completed, the Board will provide additional information on the distribution to Ethos Capital


shareholders.
