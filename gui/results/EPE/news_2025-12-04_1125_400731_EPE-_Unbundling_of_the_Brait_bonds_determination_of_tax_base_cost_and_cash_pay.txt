UNBUNDLING BY ETHOS CAPITAL OF THE BRAIT EXCHANGEABLE BONDS DETERMINATION


OF TAX BASE COST FOR SOUTH AFRICAN INCOME TAX PURPOSES AND CASH PAYMENT IN


RESPECT OF FRACTIONAL ENTITLEMENTS




PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT NOTE AT THE END OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT




1.      INTRODUCTION




1.1     Shareholders of Ethos Capital ("Ethos Capital Shareholders") are referred to various


        announcements released by the Company on the Stock Exchange News Service


        operated by JSE Limited ("SENS"), including the declaration announcement released


        by the Company on Tuesday, 18 November 2025 (the "Declaration Announcement"),


        wherein Ethos Capital Shareholders were advised that the board of directors of Ethos


        Capital had decided (based on the recommendation of the Investment Advisor) to


        unbundle the remaining portion of Ethos Capital's investment in Brait plc ("Brait"),


        comprising of the senior unsecured exchangeable registered bonds in Brait Investment


        Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Brait (the "Brait Bonds") to Ethos


        Capital Shareholders (the "2025 Brait Unbundling").




1.2     The purpose of this announcement is to notify Ethos Capital Shareholders of:




1.2.1   the determination of the base cost of the unbundled Brait Bonds (the "Brait


        Distribution Bonds") and Ethos Capital A Ordinary shares (the "Ethos Capital


        Shares") pursuant to the 2025 Brait Unbundling; and




1.2.2   the amounts which will be used to determine the cash payment in respect of


        fractional entitlements to the Brait Distribution Bonds to which Ethos Capital


        Shareholders may become entitled pursuant to the 2025 Brait Unbundling


        ("Fractional Entitlements").




1.3     The summary of the tax consequences of the 2025 Brait Unbundling, as set out below


        and in the Declaration Announcement, represents general comments and does not


        constitute a complete analysis of the tax consequences to Ethos Capital Shareholders


        pursuant to the 2025 Brait Unbundling or the payment of Fractional Entitlements. It is


        not intended to be, nor should it be interpreted to be, legal or tax advice. Neither Ethos


        Capital, Brait nor its advisors, directors or employees can be held responsible for the


        tax consequences of the 2025 Brait Unbundling. Ethos Capital Shareholders are advised


        to consult their own professional tax advisors in this regard. The tax consequences of


        the 2025 Brait Unbundling may also be different for non-resident shareholders based


        on their country of residence. This includes the calculation of the costs of the Ethos


        Capital Shares and the Brait Distribution Bonds for tax purposes going forward.




1.4     All capitalised terms used but not defined in this announcement shall bear the meanings


        ascribed to them in the Declaration Announcement.




2.      ALLOCATION TAX PRINCIPLES




2.1     The 2025 Brait Unbundling does not constitute an unbundling transaction for South


        African tax purposes as set out in section 46 of the South African Income Tax Act, 57 of


        1962 (the "Income Tax Act").




2.2     For South African tax purposes, the 2025 Brait Unbundling will comprise a foreign return


        of capital as defined in section 1 of the Income Tax Act and as such, no South African


        dividend tax arises.




2.3     In accordance with the Eighth Schedule to the Income Tax Act:




2.3.1   where a foreign return of capital by way of a distribution of the Brait Distribution


        Bonds is received by or accrues to a holder of an Ethos Capital Share, the Ethos


        Capital Shareholder must reduce the base cost in respect of each Ethos Capital


        Share by an amount equal to the market value of the Brait Distribution Bonds on


        the date that each Brait Distribution Bond accrues to the Ethos Capital


        Shareholder; and




2.3.2   the Ethos Capital Shareholder is deemed to have acquired the Brait Distribution


        Bonds for an amount equal to the market value thereof on the date that each Brait


        Distribution Bond accrues to the Ethos Capital Shareholder for purposes of


        determining the base cost thereof.




2.4     Ethos Capital Shareholders are notified that the closing price of the Brait Bonds and the


        Ethos Capital Shares respectively on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on Friday,


        5 December 2025, being the record date for the 2025 Brait Unbundling (the "Record


        Date"), will be announced by Ethos Capital on Friday, 5 December 2025 in accordance


        with the JSE Corporate Actions Timetable.




2.5     The base cost of each Ethos Capital Share held by an Ethos Capital Shareholder that


        qualified for the distribution will need to be reduced by the base cost apportionment


        amount as set out under paragraph 3 below.




3.      APPORTIONMENT FOR TAX PURPOSES




3.1     As set out in the Declaration Announcement, each Ethos Capital Shareholder is entitled


        to receive 0.00086 Brait Distribution Bonds for every one Ethos Capital Share held on


        the Record Date (the "Distribution Ratio"). The current base cost in respect of each


        Ethos Capital Share must be reduced by an amount that is derived from the market value


        of the Brait Distribution Bonds on the date that each Brait Distribution Bond accrues to


        the Ethos Capital Shareholder. For purposes of this announcement, Ethos Capital has


        assumed that the market value will be the closing price of the Brait Bonds on the Record


        Date (ie Friday, 5 December 2025).




3.2     The base cost of each Ethos Capital Share must therefore be reduced by an amount in


        Rand that is based on the Distribution Ratio multiplied by the closing price of the Brait


        Bonds on the Record Date.




3.3     Ethos Capital will announce this amount along with the closing price of the Brait Bonds


        and the Ethos Capital Shares respectively on SENS on Friday, 5 December 2024.




4.      FRACTIONAL ENTITLEMENTS




4.1     Where an Ethos Capital Shareholder's entitlement to the Brait Distribution Bonds in


        terms of the 2025 Brait Unbundling, calculated in accordance with the Distribution Ratio,


        gives rise to a fraction of any Brait Distribution Bonds, such allocation must be rounded


        down to the nearest whole number, resulting in allocations of whole Brait Distribution


        Bonds and a cash payment in respect of the fraction to such shareholder(s). As indicated


        in the Declaration Announcement, the aggregated excess fractional entitlements to the


        Brait Distribution Bonds to which Ethos Capital Shareholders would otherwise be


        entitled will not be transferred to Ethos Capital Shareholders, but will instead be sold


        on behalf of and at the risk of the relevant Ethos Capital Shareholders in the market as


        soon as practicable following the implementation of the 2025 Brait Unbundling, thereby


        resulting in the cash payment to Ethos Capital Shareholders contemplated herein.




4.2     In accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements, Fractional Entitlements payments to


        shareholders will be calculated based on the volume weighted average traded price of


        the Brait Bonds on the LDT+1, being Wednesday, 3 December 2025 ("VWAP on


        LDT+1"), less 10%, as detailed below ?




                  VWAP on LDT+1                   Amount that will be used to determine


                                                    the cash payment for the Fractional


  an Ethos Capital Share, the Ethos


        Capital Shareholder must reduce the base cost in respect of each Ethos Capital


        Share by an amount equal to the market value of the Brait Distribution Bonds on


        the date that each Brait Distribution Bond accrues to the Ethos Capital


        Shareholder; and




2.3.2   the Ethos Capital Shareholder is deemed to have acquired the Brait Distribution


        Bonds for an amount equal to the market value thereof on the date that each Brait


        Distribution Bond accrues to the Ethos Capital Shareholder for purposes of


        determining the base cost thereof.




2.4     Ethos Capital Shareholders are notified that the closing price of the Brait Bonds and the


        Ethos Capital Shares respectively on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange on Friday,


        5 December 2025, being the record date for the 2025 Brait Unbundling (the "Record


        Date"), will be announced by Ethos Capital on Friday, 5 December 2025 in accordance


        with the JSE Corporate Actions Timetable.




2.5     The base cost of each Ethos Capital Share held by an Ethos Capital Shareholder that


        qualified for the distribution will need to be reduced by the base cost apportionment


        amount as set out under paragraph 3 below.




3.      APPORTIONMENT FOR TAX PURPOSES




3.1     As set out in the Declaration Announcement, each Ethos Capital Shareholder is entitled


        to receive 0.00086 Brait Distribution Bonds for every one Ethos Capital Share held on


        the Record Date (the "Distribution Ratio"). The current base cost in respect of each


        Ethos Capital Share must be reduced by an amount that is derived from the market value


        of the Brait Distribution Bonds on the date that each Brait Distribution Bond accrues to


        the Ethos Capital Shareholder. For purposes of this announcement, Ethos Capital has


        assumed that the market value will be the closing price of the Brait Bonds on the Record


        Date (ie Friday, 5 December 2025).




3.2     The base cost of each Ethos Capital Share must therefore be reduced by an amount in


        Rand that is based on the Distribution Ratio multiplied by the closing price of the Brait


        Bonds on the Record Date.




3.3     Ethos Capital will announce this amount along with the closing price of the Brait Bonds


        and the Ethos Capital Shares respectively on SENS on Friday, 5 December 2024.




4.      FRACTIONAL ENTITLEMENTS




4.1     Where an Ethos Capital Shareholder's entitlement to the Brait Distribution Bonds in


        terms of the 2025 Brait Unbundling, calculated in accordance with the Distribution Ratio,


        gives rise to a fraction of any Brait Distribution Bonds, such allocation must be rounded


        down to the nearest whole number, resulting in allocations of whole Brait Distribution


        Bonds and a cash payment in respect of the fraction to such shareholder(s). As indicated


        in the Declaration Announcement, the aggregated excess fractional entitlements to the


        Brait Distribution Bonds to which Ethos Capital Shareholders would otherwise be


        entitled will not be transferred to Ethos Capital Shareholders, but will instead be sold


        on behalf of and at the risk of the relevant Ethos Capital Shareholders in the market as


        soon as practicable following the implementation of the 2025 Brait Unbundling, thereby


        resulting in the cash payment to Ethos Capital Shareholders contemplated herein.




4.2     In accordance with the JSE Listings Requirements, Fractional Entitlements payments to


        shareholders will be calculated based on the volume weighted average traded price of


        the Brait Bonds on the LDT+1, being Wednesday, 3 December 2025 ("VWAP on


        LDT+1"), less 10%, as detailed below ?




                  VWAP on LDT+1                   Amount that will be used to determine


                                                    the cash payment for the Fractional


                                                    Entitlements (ie VWAP on LDT+1 less


                                                                                   10%)




             77,520.97660 cents                                      69,768.87894 cents




4.3     Cash payments in respect of the Fractional Entitlements are expected to be made on


        Monday, 8 December 2025 to the CSDP or broker accounts of dematerialised Ethos


        Capital Shareholders or to the bank accounts of certificated Ethos Capital Shareholders.




4.4     Certificated Ethos Capital Shareholders whose bank account details are not held by the


        transfer secretaries, should provide such details to the transfer secretaries to enable


        payment of the cash amount due. Should no details be on record, the funds will be held


        by the Company in trust in terms of the provisions of the Constitution of the Company


        until such time as the details have been provided, whereafter the cash entitlement will


        be paid to the shareholder upon its request.




4.5     Shareholders are informed that, as far as the tax implications of the cash payment in


        respect of the Fractional Entitlements is concerned, to the extent that Cash Proceeds


        exceed that tax base cost of such Fractional Entitlements, the receipt of the cash


        payment by shareholders will typically be subject to capital gains tax for shareholders


        holding Ethos Capital Shares as capital assets.
