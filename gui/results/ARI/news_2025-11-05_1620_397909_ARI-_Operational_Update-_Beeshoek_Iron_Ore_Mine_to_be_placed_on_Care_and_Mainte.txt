OPERATIONAL UPDATE: BEESHOEK IRON ORE MINE TO BE PLACED ON CARE


AND MAINTENANCE


ARM advises shareholders that Assmang Proprietary Limited


("Assmang"), jointly owned by ARM and Assore South Africa


Proprietary Limited ("Assore"), has taken the decision to place


the Beeshoek Iron Ore Mine ("Beeshoek Mine") on care and


maintenance. This follows the cessation of iron ore offtake by


its sole customer, ArcelorMittal South Africa Limited ("AMSA"),


and an extensive review of operational, commercial and financial


alternatives.


Beeshoek Mine is an ageing mine with legacy infrastructure and


a cost base that is dependent on sales to AMSA. AMSA has


significantly reduced its offtake from Beeshoek over the past


five years and, following the expiry of the supply contract on


30 June 2024, continued to purchase iron ore on a month-to-month


basis with deliveries to AMSA ceasing on 27 July 2025. No further


sales to AMSA are expected for the remainder of the year.


Assmang undertook an extensive assessment of potential


alternatives to avoid a shutdown of Beeshoek Mine, none of which


options proved economically viable. In the absence of a


sustainable offtake arrangement, Beeshoek Mine is no longer


economically feasible to operate. Mining operations at Beeshoek


Mine therefore ceased at the end of October 2025.


Assmang   has   concluded   a   structured   and   comprehensive


consultation process in accordance with section 189(3) of the


Labour Relations Act. In parallel, a notification in terms of


section 52(1) of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development


Act was submitted to the Department of Mineral and Petroleum


Resources on 21 August 2025.


Approximately 622 permanent workers will be retrenched effective


30 November 2025. Assmang is providing the affected employees


with the necessary support, including access to wellness


programmes, financial planning and budgeting support, curriculum


vitae writing assistance, employment-seeking opportunities,


reskilling programme options, and entrepreneurship training.


The Company will continue to engage with all affected


stakeholders and keep shareholders informed of material


developments.


In parallel with the care-and-maintenance process, Assmang is


evaluating further options for Beeshoek Mine.
