Salient features


Financial:


  - Headline earnings for the year ended 30 June 2025 (F2025)


    decreased by 47% to R2 695 million or R13.79 per share (F2024:


    R5 080 million or R25.91 per share)


  - Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2025 increased by 1% to


    R13 027 million(F2024: R12 921 million)


  - A final dividend of R6.00 per share is declared (F2024: R9.00


    per share), this brings the total dividend for F2025 to


    R10.50 per share (F2024: R15.00 per share)


  - ARM maintained a robust financial position, with net cash of


    R6 609 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: R7 197 million).


Operational:


   - The marginal increase in the average US dollar 6E platinum


     group metals (PGM) basket price and the marginally higher


     manganese ore and alloy prices was offset by lower thermal coal


     prices, lower average realised export iron ore prices and a


     stronger average rand/US dollar exchange rate


   - Unit cash costs growth for PGMs and iron ore improved,


     increasing in line with inflationary cost increases.


Safety and Health:


   - Regrettably, there were three fatalities recorded at our


     operations during the period. We extend our deepest condolences


     to the deceased employees' families, friends and colleagues


   - The group's lost-time injury frequency rate(LTIFR) regressed to


     0.31 per 200 000 man-hours (F2024: 0.22)


   - The group total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR)


     regressed to 0.51 (F2024: 0.50).


Environmental:


   - Water supply to Khumani Mine remained consistent during the


     second half of the year with no significant operational


     disruptions caused by water shortages


   - As at the end of June 2025, construction of the solar plant for


     ARM's platinum operations reached completion. Electricity from


     this plant will be supplied to the mining operations through a


     Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) by Q2 F2026.


Growth:


   - To limit expenditure, a decision was taken to suspend early


     ounces mining operations at Bokoni at the end of F2025. We are


     now advancing capital development of the larger mine in a way


     that ensures its long-term sustainability. We remain confident


     in our approach to unlock value from Bokoni's exceptional


     resource base while exercising strict capital discipline


     considering the ongoing PGM price uncertainty


   - Implementation of a hedging collar transaction over 24% of ARM's


     equity in Harmony


   - Delisting of ordinary shares following a share buyback and


     transfer of ARM treasury shares within the group


   - Closure of Cato Ridge Works and Alloys, disposal of certain


     land assets of Assmang and Assmang's interest in Sakura


   - ARM has increased its stake in Surge Copper Corp to 19.9%


     through a private placement and earlier top-up purchase,


     strengthening its position as Surge advances its pre-


     feasibility study scheduled for completion in 2026.


Safety performance


ARM remains committed to ensuring a safe and healthy work environment


for all employees and to achieve our goal of zero harm. TRIFR(1)


regressed by 2% to 0.51 (F2024: 0.50) and the group LTIFR regressed


by 41% to 0.31 per 200 000 man-hours (F2024: 0.22).


Regrettably, there were 3 fatalities recorded in F2025 (F2024:1).


On the 29th of November 2024, Mr Tshepo Tebelo was fatally injured in


a winch-related incident at Modikwa Mine.


On the 27th of December 2024, Mr William Kodibona succumbed to injuries


related to an underground rigging accident at Bokoni Mine.


On the 18th of April 2025, Mr Stanley Kgotlayame Mongale, was fatally


injured in a fall of ground (FOG) incident at Black Rock Mine.


We extend our deepest condolences to the affected family members,


friends and colleagues of the deceased.


Support and counselling were provided to all affected families and


colleagues of the deceased through the employee assistance programme.


Independent root cause investigations were undertaken.


Continuous efforts are in place to strengthen safety measures and


improve overall safety performance.


Safety achievements in F2025 included:


-   Two Rivers Platinum Mine achieved 3 million fatality-free shifts


    over ~2 years.


-   Khumani Mine achieved 6 million fatality-free shifts over ~9


    years.


-   Beeshoek Mine achieved 6 million fatality-free shifts over ~22


    years.


(1) TRIFR includes the number of fatal injuries, the number of lost-time


injuries, and the number of medical treatment cases.


Financial performance


Headline earnings for F2025 decreased by 47% to R2 695 million or


R13.79 per share (F2024: R5 080 million or R25.91 per share). The


decline in headline earnings was mainly due to a decrease in the


average realised export US dollar iron ore prices and increased


mechanised development costs at Bokoni.


The average realised rand strengthened by 3% versus the US dollar to


R18.15/US$ compared to R18.70/US$ in F2024. For reporting purposes,


the closing exchange rate at 30 June 2025 was R17.77/US$ (30 June


2024: R18.25/US$).


ARM Ferrous headline earnings were 31% lower at R3 472 million


(F2024: R5 058 million), driven by a 36% decrease in headline


earnings in the iron ore division. This was partially offset by a


120% increase in headline earnings in the manganese division.


Lower headline earnings in iron ore division were mainly driven by


a decrease in the average realised export US dollar iron ore prices,


lower local sales volumes as well as the stronger Rand/US dollar


exchange rate.


Higher headline earnings in the manganese division were driven by


an increase in manganese ore sales volumes and average manganese


ore sales prices.


ARM Platinum reported a headline loss of R1.3 billion (F2024:


R910 million loss), largely due to higher operational losses at Bokoni.


Two Rivers Mine headline earnings increased by 20% to R202 million


(F2024: R168 million), mainly due to a 2% improvement in the average


PGM rand basket price. The mine's production decreased marginally,


while unit cash costs (rand per 6E PGM ounce) increased by 5%.


Modikwa Mine reported a headline loss of R43 million (F2024: R121


million loss). The mine's production decreased by 3%, while unit


cash cost (rand per 6E PGM ounce) increased by 3%.


Bokoni Mine reported a headline loss of R1.4 billion (F2024:


R566 million). In the current year Bokoni ramped up its operations,


however, it was negatively impacted by operational challenges, high


fixed costs associated with the early ounce production and increased


mechanised development costs.


For more detail and a table showing the mark-to-market adjustments


at Two Rivers, Modikwa and Bokoni mines, refer to page 14 of the


full announcement.


Nkomati Mine reported an attributable headline loss of R55 million


(F2024: R391 million). The headline loss decreased due to the F2024


headline loss being negatively impacted by an increase in


rehabilitation liabilities relating to water management costs.


ARM Coal headline earnings decreased by 88% to R47 million (F2024:


R391 million), driven mainly by a reduction in the realised coal


price as well as lower saleable volumes from GGV and PCB.


GGV Mine's headline earnings were R134 million (F2024: R331


million). PCB recorded a headline loss of R87 million (F2024:


R60 million headline earnings).


Refer to pages 19 and 20 of the full announcement for a detailed


analysis of the GGV and PCB operational profit performance.


ARM Corporate and Other (including Gold) reported headline earnings


of R558 million (F2024: R762 million). Included in ARM Corporate


and Other are dividends received from Harmony of R240 million (F2024:


R166 million) and management fees received from Assmang of


R1 366 million (F2024: R1 503 million).


Machadodorp Works headline loss of R94 million (F2024: R221 million)


related to research on developing energy-efficient smelting


technology.


Basic earnings and impairments


Basic earnings of R330 million or R1.69 per share (F2024: R3 146


million or R16.04 per share) included attributable impairments as


follows:


An impairment of property, plant and equipment at Bokoni of


R2 209 million, with no tax effect


An impairment of property, plant and equipment at Assmang of


R139 million, after tax


An impairment of the investment in Sakura of R36 million, with no


tax effect.


Refer to note 4 of the condensed group financial statements in the


full announcement for further details on these impairments.


Financial position and cash flow


At 30 June 2025, ARM had net cash of R6 609 million (30 June 2024:


R7 197 million), a decrease of R588 million compared to the end of the


2024 financial year. This amount excludes attributable cash and cash


equivalents held at ARM Ferrous (50% of Assmang) of R3 568 million


(30 June 2024: R4 476 million). There was no debt at ARM Ferrous in either


of the reporting periods.


Cash generated from operations decreased by R1 726 million to R45


million (F2024: R1 771 million) after an outflow in working capital


of R1 214 million (F2024: R130 million outflow). This was mainly due


to an outflow in trade payables and reduction in receivables inflow.


In F2025, ARM paid R2 644 million in dividends to its shareholders,


representing the interim dividend of R4.50 and final dividend of


R9.00 per share declared for F2024 (F2024: R3 529 million


representing the interim dividend of R6.00 and F2023 final dividend


of R12.00 per share).


Net cash outflow from investing activities was R2 433 million


(F2024: R6 556 million) and included R2 658 million (F2024:


R6 292 million) additions to property, plant and equipment.


Borrowings of R62 million (F2024: R62 million) were repaid and


borrowings of R925 million were raised during the period, resulting


in gross debt of R2 035 million at 30 June 2024 (30 June 2024:


R1 129 million).


Investing in growth and the existing business


Implementation of a hedging collar transaction over 24% of ARM's equity


in Harmony


ARM implemented a hedging collar transaction involving 18 million


shares in Harmony Gold, representing 24% of its equity in Harmony, the


collar and related arrangements provides ARM with access to future


funding on efficient terms while retaining partial upside exposure.


The structure includes a put option at R234.85 and a call option at


R562.40, both maturing in June 2030.


ARM remains fully committed to Harmony as a strategic investment and


remains confident in Harmony and its management's ability to drive


growth and value for its shareholders.


Please refer to the announcement released on the Stock Exchange News


Service (SENS) on 11 June 2025 for further details.


Delisting of ordinary shares pursuant to a general repurchase and


intra-group distribution of ARM treasury shares


ARM, in accordance with the general authority granted by shareholders


at the Company's annual general meeting held on 6 December 2024, has


cumulatively repurchased and cancelled 3 239 681 ordinary shares, at


an average price of R154.27 per share, totalling approximately


R499.8 million. Additionally, ARM's subsidiary, Opilac, distributed


12 717 328 treasury shares in specie back to ARM, which were cancelled and


delisted. These actions reduced the total issued share capital to


208 710 769 ordinary shares. The cancellation of the treasury shares has


no impact on the earnings per share and headline earnings per share


of ARM.


Please refer to the announcement released on SENS on 20 June 2025 for


further details.


Closure of Cato Ridge Works and Alloys, disposal of certain land assets


of Assmang and Assmang's interest in Sakura


ARM has announced a series of strategic transactions involving its 50%


held joint venture, Assmang. These include the permanent closure of


the Cato Ridge Works plant, effective 31 August 2025. Assmang will


also sell various land, properties, and houses in Cato Ridge to Assore


S.A. PropCo Proprietary Limited for R453 million, with part of the


land designated for community benefit. Additionally, Assmang will


dispose of its 54.36% stake in Sakura Ferroalloys to Assore, resulting


in a R900 million cash distribution to ARM.


Please refer to the announcement released on SENS on 30 June 2025 for


further details.


Surge Copper


ARM has entered into a subscription agreement to acquire 25.8 million


common shares of Surge Copper Corp. through a non-brokered private


placement for a total consideration of approximately C$4.5 million.


This follows ARM's earlier exercise of its rights under an investor


rights agreement, where it purchased 1.6 million shares for C$0.24


million in a top-up offering. Prior to these transactions, ARM held


43.0 million shares (13.4% of Surge's issued shares), and upon


completion of the private placement, its shareholding will increase


to 68.7 million shares, representing 19.9% of the company on a non-


diluted basis. Surge Copper has made strong progress on the pre-


feasibility study, which remains on track for completion in 2026.


Please refer to the announcement released on SENS on 15 August 2025


for further details.


Bokoni Mine


Operations at Bokoni were suspended at the end of F2025, with current


mining and milling capacity proving insufficient to offset fixed costs


and sustain profitability. Ore reserve development is advancing to


support a phased ramp-up to 240 thousand tonnes per month (ktpm)


production rate, regarded as the optimum throughput to unlock


economies of scale and deliver sustainable returns.


This strategy is anchored by Bokoni's large, high-grade Mineral


Resource, which positions the mine competitively on the cost curve at


steady state production. To accelerate cash generation and reduce


funding needs, the existing 60ktpm concentrator will be restarted


ahead of the new 120ktpm plant, with timing carefully sequenced to ore


availability and ramp-up milestones.


We remain confident that this strategy is the right approach to unlock


value from Bokoni's exceptional resource base while exercising strict


capital discipline, considering ongoing commodity price uncertainty.


Capital expenditure for the divisions is shown on page 9 of the full


announcement   and  discussed   in   each   division's   operational


performance section from page 10 of the full announcement.
