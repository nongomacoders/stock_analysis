PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS


Super Group's strategic execution on a number of corporate actions has delivered significant value to shareholders, marking a transformative year for the


Group. Key divestments, including the sale of SG Fleet and the inTime business in Germany, streamlined operations and improved the Group's financial


position. This decisive repositioning strengthened Super Group's balance sheet, reduced debt and set the stage for sustainable, scalable growth across its


core Southern African and international markets.


The sale of SG Fleet unlocked R7.47 billion in capital and enabled the distribution of a special dividend of R16.30 per ordinary share - amounting to R5.54


billion - to shareholders, alongside a R1.96 billion repayment of interest-bearing debt. This capital redeployment dramatically improved the Group's balance


sheet, reducing net gearing from 136.3% to 20.6% and improving net debt to EBITDA from 2.96x to 0.75x.


Despite difficult trading conditions, Super Group's performance for the year ended 30 June 2025 reflects an ability to adapt amid continued global


uncertainty. While macroeconomic and infrastructural challenges persist within the commodity businesses, in particular, a focus on service excellence and on


the strategic deployment of capital into high growth opportunities, positions the Group optimally to navigate these challenges.
