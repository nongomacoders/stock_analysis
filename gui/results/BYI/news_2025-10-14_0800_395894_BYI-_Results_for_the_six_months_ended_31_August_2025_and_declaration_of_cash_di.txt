    (1) GII is a non-International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) alternative performance measure that reflects gross income


    billed to customers adjusted for deferred and accrued revenue items. GII has a direct influence on our movements in working


    capital.


    (2) 'Revenue' is reported in accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Under this standard, the Group


    is required to exercise judgement to determine whether the Group is acting as principal or agent in performing its contractual


    obligations. Revenue in respect of contracts for which the Group is determined to be acting as an agent is recognised on a


    'net' basis (the gross profit achieved on the contract and not the gross income billed to the customer). Our key financial metrics


    of gross invoiced income, gross profit, operating profit and cash conversion are unaffected by this judgement.


    (3)'Cash conversion' is a non-IFRS alternative performance measure that divides cash generated from operations less capital


    expenditure (together, 'free cash flow') by operating profit. It is calculated over both the current 6 month reporting period and


    over a rolling 12 months, the latter taking the previous 12 months free cash flow divided by the previous 12 months operating


    profit, in order to reflect seasonal variations between the two halves of the year.


    Financial highlights


    -    GII increased 9.1%, with 8.9% growth in software and 15.1% in services.


    -    GP increased 0.4%. Segmentally public sector, more impacted by Microsoft's partner incentive changes, was


         +1.6% and corporate, which adjusted to the new sales structure launched at the start of the year, was -0.6%.


         Software GP down 3.5% was offset by strong growth in services which increased over 40% consistent with our


         strategic objective to grow services income and profit.


    -    Operating profit down 7.0%, with higher headcount, salary and national insurance costs only partly mitigated


         by lower variable remuneration.


    -    Strong balance sheet with closing cash of £82.3m.


    -    Interim dividend of 3.2p, increased by 3.2% from last year's interim dividend (H1 FY25: 3.1 pence).


    -    Outlook: We remain confident of delivering a full year outcome within the range of market expectations.


    Operational highlights


    -    New corporate sales structure has settled after an adjustment period.


    -    Customers that traded with BTG in the prior year contributed 98% of our GP in this half year (H1 FY25: 98%)


    -    Headcount up 12.0% year-on-year to 1,266 (up 1.7% since 28 February 2025).


    -    Received multiple vendor awards including from Axonius, Barracuda, Checkpoint, Sophos, Varonis and


         VMWare.


    -    Both Bytes Software Services and Phoenix Software named among the UK's top 100 Best Workplaces 2025


         with Phoenix Software in the top 10.


    Interim dividend


    The Group's dividend policy is to distribute 40-50% of post-tax pre-exceptional earnings to shareholders.


    Accordingly, the Board is pleased to declare a gross interim dividend of 3.2 pence per share. The aggregate


    amount of the interim dividend expected to be paid out of retained earnings at 31 August 2025, but not recognised


    as a liability at the end of the half year, is £7.6m.


    The salient dates applicable to the dividend are as follows:

    Current trading and outlook


    We are well positioned to benefit from the structural demand drivers we see in our markets including cloud


    computing, cyber security and AI for the remainder of FY26. We have a strong pipeline and have started H2 FY26


    well but are mindful that comparatives will be impacted by the particularly strong trading performance we saw in


    the last few months of the prior financial year. We remain confident of delivering a full year outcome within the


    range of market expectations.
