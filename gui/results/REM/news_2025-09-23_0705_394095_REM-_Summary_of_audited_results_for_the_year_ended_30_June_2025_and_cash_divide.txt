SUMMARY OF AUDITED RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2025 AND CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION


SALIENT FEATURES


? Headline earnings per share: up by 38.4% to R14.09


? Ordinary dividend per share: up by 30.3% to 344 cents


? Special dividend per share: 200 cents


? Earnings per share: up 165.6% to R5.95


INTRODUCTION


The positive momentum seen in the first half of this financial year in the execution against Remgro's stated strategic


objective of disciplined capital allocation and active partnership to drive performance, was sustained in the second half.


This is evidenced by continued improvements in earnings contributions across the portfolio, with more than 80% of


Remgro's portfolio achieving growth in headline earnings in this reporting period.


Remgro is pleased with the progress that has been achieved against its strategic priorities and believes that a more


focused investment thesis is starting to emerge from these results. It has now been five years since Remgro set out on


a path to simplify, optimise, and focus its portfolio. This strategy has been executed on with determination, and the results


of this execution are starting to reflect in the improved performance seen in this year; with a portfolio that is more


streamlined, has greater scarcity, is robustly capitalised, and better positioned for growth.


Focus will remain on driving returns through disciplined execution from its portfolio of quality assets and continuing the


path of sharpening and simplifying the Remgro portfolio as well as in seeking out capital allocation opportunities that will


create sustainable returns for its shareholders.


RESULTS


For the year under review, headline earnings increased by 38.6% from R5 647 million to R7 827 million, while headline


earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 38.4% from R10.18 to R14.09. The earnings growth momentum experienced in


the first half of the year under review continued during the second half, culminating in the 39% increase in headline


earnings. The increase in headline earnings can be summarised as follows:


? Improved operational performances from the majority of the investee companies, of which the most significant are:


      -   increased contributions from Mediclinic Group Limited (Mediclinic) (excluding the Mediclinic acquisition costs and


          an increase in a redemption liability in the comparative year ? refer below) (+R362 million), OUTsurance Group


          Limited (+R318 million), Rainbow Chicken Limited (+R324 million) and RCL Foods Limited (RCL Foods)


          (+R264 million), due to improved operational performances;


      -   Heineken Beverages Holdings Limited (Heineken Beverages) (excluding the Heineken IFRS 3 impact ? refer


          below) returning to profitability, driven by volume growth and margin recovery (+R406 million);


      -   partly offset by lower contributions from TotalEnergies Marketing South Africa Proprietary Limited (-R359 million),


          mainly due to higher negative stock revaluations, and lower dividends from Momentum Group Limited


          (-R160 million) following its disposal.


? Lower finance costs due to the redemption of the preference shares (+R403 million).


? For the year under review, the negative impact of significant corporate actions, which were implemented during


  previous financial years, amounted to R140 million (2024: R766 million). These include the following:


      -   Remgro's portion of the IFRS 3 amortisation and depreciation charges amounting to R140 million (2024:


          R257 million) relating to the additional assets identified when Heineken Beverages obtained control over Distell


          Group Holdings Limited (Distell) and Namibia Breweries Limited (the Distell/Heineken transaction) (Heineken


          IFRS 3 impact);


      -   Remgro's portion of an increase in a redemption liability amounting to R344 million in the comparative year,


          relating to Mediclinic's acquisition of Hirslanden La Colline Grangettes SA; and


      -   Remgro's portion of transaction costs amounting to R165 million in the comparative year, which were incurred in


          respect of the acquisition, through Remgro's 50% interest in Manta Bidco Limited, which is jointly owned by


          Remgro and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA, of the entire issued ordinary share capital of Mediclinic


          (the Mediclinic acquisition).


Total earnings amounted to R3 303 million (2024: R1 241 million). This increase in earnings is mainly due to the increase


in headline earnings discussed above (R2 180 million), the impairment of Remgro's investment in Heineken Beverages


in the comparative year (R4 257 million) and Remgro's portion of the impairment of Heineken Beverages' goodwill that


was created through the Distell/Heineken transaction in the comparative year (R1 050 million). The increase was partially


offset by Remgro's portion of the impairment of Mediclinic's assets in Switzerland (R3 436 million), the impairment of


Remgro's investment in eMedia Investments Proprietary Limited (R502 million) and Remgro's portion of the impairment


of Capevin Holdings Proprietary Limited's (Capevin) goodwill, as well as the profit realised in the comparative year relating


to the disposal of the investment in DC Foods Proprietary Limited, Remgro's portion of the profit realised by RCL Foods


on the disposal of its Vector Logistics business and Remgro's portion of the profit realised by Capevin on the termination


of the Gordon's Gin agreement.


The headline earnings growth momentum resulted in strong cash earnings generation at the centre (Remgro head


office), mainly due to higher dividends received from investee companies, as well as lower finance cost.


INTRINSIC NET ASSET VALUE


Remgro's intrinsic net asset value per share increased by 16.5% from R251.01 at 30 June 2024 to R292.34 at


30 June 2025. The closing share price at 30 June 2025 was R158.20 (2024: R136.09), representing a discount of 45.9%


(2024: 45.8%) to the intrinsic net asset value.


DECLARATION OF CASH DIVIDEND NO. 50


Notice is hereby given that a final gross dividend of 248 cents (2024: 184 cents) per share has been declared out of


income reserves in respect of both the ordinary shares of no par value and the unlisted B ordinary shares of no par value,


for the year ended 30 June 2025.


The total gross dividend per share, excluding the special dividend, for the year ended 30 June 2025 therefore amounts to


344 cents, compared to 264 cents for the year ended 30 June 2024.


DECLARATION OF SPECIAL DIVIDEND


Notice is hereby given that a special dividend of 200 cents per share has been declared out of income reserves in respect


of both the ordinary shares of no par value and the unlisted B ordinary shares of no par value, for the year ended


30 June 2025.


The Board is satisfied that the Company is solvent and liquid, thus confirming that the Company has sufficient capital and


reserves after the payment of the final and special dividend, to support its operations for the foreseeable future.


These dividends will be subject to dividend withholding tax of 20%, resulting in a net dividend of 198.40 cents per share


in respect of the ordinary dividend and 160 cents per share in respect of the special dividend, unless the shareholder


concerned is exempt from paying dividend withholding tax or is entitled to a reduced rate in terms of an applicable double-


tax agreement.


The issued share capital at the declaration date is 529 217 007 ordinary shares and 39 056 987 B ordinary shares. The


income tax number of the Company is 9500-124-71-5.
