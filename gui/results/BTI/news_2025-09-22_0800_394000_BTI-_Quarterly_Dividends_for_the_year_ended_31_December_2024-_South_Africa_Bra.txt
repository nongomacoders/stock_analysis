South Africa Branch Register Finalisation Information


On 13 February 2025, the Company announced that the Board had declared an interim dividend of


240.24p per ordinary share of 25p, payable in four equal quarterly instalments of 60.06p per


ordinary share in May 2025, August 2025, November 2025 and February 2026.


The November 2025 Dividend will be payable on 7 November 2025 to shareholders registered on


either the UK main register or the South Africa branch register on 3 October 2025 (the record date).


In accordance with the JSE Limited ("JSE") Listing Requirements, the finalisation information for the


November 2025 Dividend relating to shareholders registered on the South Africa branch register is


set out in the paragraphs below.


The salient dates and other dividend declaration information announced on 13 February 2025 remain


unchanged for the November 2025 Dividend.


South Africa Branch Register: Dividend Rate


The British American Tobacco Group reports in sterling, therefore dividends are declared and


payable in sterling except for shareholders on the branch register in South Africa whose dividends


are payable in rand. A rate of exchange of £:R=23.5111 as at 18 September 2025 (the closing rate on


that date as quoted by Bloomberg), results in an equivalent November 2025 Dividend of 1412.07667


SA cents per ordinary share.


South Africa Branch Register: Dividends Tax Information


South Africa Dividends Tax (at a rate of 20%), equivalent to 282.41533 SA cents per ordinary share,


will be withheld from the gross November 2025 Dividend paid to shareholders on the South Africa


branch register, unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption. After Dividends Tax has been


withheld, the net dividend will be 1129.66134 cents per ordinary share. The November 2025


Dividend is regarded as a 'foreign dividend' for the purposes of the South Africa Dividends Tax. For


the purposes of South Africa Dividends Tax reporting, the source of income for the payment of the


November 2025 Dividend is the United Kingdom.


At the close of business on 18 September 2025 (the latest practicable date prior to the date of the


declaration of the South African rand equivalent of the November 2025 Dividend), the Company had


a total of 2,188,928,781 ordinary shares in issue (excluding treasury shares). The Company held


132,999,412 ordinary shares in treasury giving a total issued share capital of 2,321,928,193 ordinary


shares.


British American Tobacco p.l.c. is registered with the South African Revenue Service (SARS) with tax


reference number 9378193172.


For the avoidance of doubt, Dividends Tax and the information provided above is of only direct


application to shareholders on the South Africa branch register. Shareholders on the South Africa


branch register should direct any questions regarding the application of Dividends Tax to
