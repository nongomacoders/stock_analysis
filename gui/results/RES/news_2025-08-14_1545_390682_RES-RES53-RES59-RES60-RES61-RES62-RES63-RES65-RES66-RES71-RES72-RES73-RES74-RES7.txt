Unaudited financial results and declaration of interim dividend for the six months ended 30 June 2025

Unaudited financial results and declaration of interim dividend


for the six months ended 30 June 2025


Nature of the business


Resilient is a retail-focused Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT") listed on


the JSE Limited ("JSE"). Its strategy is to invest in dominant retail centres


with a minimum of three anchor tenants and let predominantly to national


retailers. A core competency is its strong development skills which support


new developments and the reconfiguration of existing shopping centres to


adapt to structural changes in the market. Resilient also invests directly


and indirectly in offshore property assets.


The Company's focus is on regions with strong growth fundamentals. Resilient


generally has the dominant offering in its target markets with strong


grocery and flagship fashion offerings.


Distributable earnings and dividend declared


The Board has declared a dividend of 245,72 cents per share for the six months


ended June 2025. This represents an increase of 12,2% compared to the


218,97 cents per share for the six months ended June 2024.


The South African portfolio recorded like-for-like comparable net property


income ("NPI") growth of 8,6% for 1H2025. Resilient's energy strategy


continues to shield against the continued rise of administered prices.


The euro dividend from Lighthouse Properties p.l.c. ("Lighthouse") for


1H2025 increased by 7,9%. Offshore distributable earnings further benefitted


from contracted forward exchange rates that were 6,1% higher than in


1H2024 (R21,92 vs R20,67).


South African interest rates reduced from 11,75% in January 2024 to 10,50% at


June 2025. On average, interest rates were 75 basis points lower during


1H2025 compared to 1H2024. To the extent that borrowings were unhedged or


hedged by way of interest rate caps, the Group benefitted from these lower


rates. However, the rebasing of in-the-money interest rate hedges that expired


during 2H2024 negatively impacted finance costs in 1H2025 compared to 1H2024.


Commentary on the results


South Africa


Retail sales increased by 6,9% during the five months ended May 2025. Sales


for the month of June 2025 were impacted by school holidays which fell


predominantly in July in the current reporting period as opposed to June in


the prior period. This resulted in an increase of 5,2% in retail sales for the


interim period, notwithstanding tough economic conditions. Strategic vacancies


resulting from asset management initiatives also affected retail sales during


the period, particularly at Boardwalk Inkwazi, Galleria Mall, Secunda Mall


and Tubatse Crossing. The sales from Mahikeng Mall were excluded from retail


sales performance following the opening of the extension in May 2024.


During the interim period, Resilient concluded 287 lease renewals over


104 527m2 of gross lettable area ("GLA") at rentals on average 2,2% higher


than expiry. Leases were concluded with 79 new tenants (17 473m2 of GLA) at


rentals on average 19,5% higher than those of the outgoing tenants. In total,


rentals for renewals and new leases increased on average by 4,9%. Escalations


of 5,5% and 5,7% were agreed for renewals and new leases, respectively.


Resilient's pro rata share of vacancies in its 1,2 million square metre


portfolio was 2,3% at June 2025. This includes planned vacancies arising


from asset management initiatives.


France


Resilient owns a 40% interest in Retail Property Investments SAS, the owner


of four shopping centres in France, in partnership with Lighthouse.


Sales across the French portfolio increased by 3,8% in 1H2025 and this


portfolio was 6,4% vacant at June 2025. The euro NPI growth of the French


portfolio was 12,0%.


Spain


Resilient and Lighthouse each own a 50% interest in Spanish Retail Investments


SAS, SA, the owner of Salera Centro Comercial ("Salera"), a shopping


centre in Castellon, Spain.


Retail sales of Salera increased by 8,5% during 1H2025 and the shopping


centre was 0,4% vacant at June 2025.


Energy projects


Resilient successfully installed an additional 5,6MWp of solar energy


generation capacity during the interim period, with a further 4,4MWp


scheduled for completion by the end of the financial year. Upon completion,


this will increase total installed capacity in the South African portfolio


to 86,5MWp. This is projected to supply approximately 39,2% of Resilient's


total energy requirements.


The 4MWh battery energy storage system ("BESS") at Irene Village Mall


and the 6MWh BESS at The Grove Mall, with automated micro-grid systems,


are fully operational. The performance to date is exceeding initial


expectations. Installation has commenced on a 4MWh BESS at both


Diamond Pavilion and Boardwalk Inkwazi. The Board has approved a


further 4MWh BESS at Mahikeng Mall.


Property valuations


Resilient's full property portfolio is subject to an independent external


valuation annually at year-end. The South African property portfolio was


therefore valued by Quadrant Properties Proprietary Limited ("Quadrant")


at December 2024. To accommodate the co-owners of Arbour Crossing,


Galleria Mall and Tzaneen Lifestyle Centre, Quadrant valued these


properties at June 2025. Resilient's share of the positive revaluation


was R126,5 million (+4,8%).


Listed portfolio


While the investment in Lighthouse remains a core component of Resilient's


offshore strategy, the Board took advantage of strong market conditions


to dispose of 39,2 million Lighthouse shares for proceeds of R332,2 million


(excluding transaction costs) to fund the development pipeline. Resilient


currently owns 27,6% of Lighthouse.

Outlook


Resilient is forecasting strong results for FY2025. The South African


portfolio continues to serve as the core of the Group's performance enhanced


by the benefits of the energy strategy. The retail market continues to show


strength notwithstanding tough economic conditions. Resilient's portfolio


is further supported from its exposure to the informal economy.


Growth from offshore investments was weighted towards 1H2025. This is


mainly due to the timing of accretive property acquisitions by Lighthouse


during FY2024 and the benefit from contracted forward exchange rates


that were in place.


Finance costs for the remainder of the year will benefit from lower


interest rates notwithstanding the negative impact from the rebasing of


R1,5 billion of in-the-money interest rate hedges that expired


during July 2025.


The Board's proactive approach to preventative maintenance enables


Resilient to maintain a payout ratio of 100%. The Board forecasts


growth in distribution of at least 8% or 475,47 cents per share


for FY2025 (FY2024: 440,25 cents per share). This guidance assumes that


interest rates remain unchanged, no loadshedding will be implemented,


Lighthouse achieves its guidance, no major corporate failures occur and


that tenants will be able to absorb the rising utility costs and municipal


rates. This guidance has not been audited, reviewed or reported on by


Resilient's auditor.


Payment of interim dividend


The Board has approved and notice is hereby given of an interim


dividend of 245,72000 cents per share for the six months ended


30 June 2025.

Divdend tax treatment


In accordance with Resilient's status as a REIT, shareholders are advised


that the dividend of 245,72000 cents per share for the six months ended


30 June 2025 ("the dividend") meets the requirements of a "qualifying


distribution" for the purposes of section 25BB of the Income Tax Act,


58 of 1962 ("Income Tax Act"). The dividend will be deemed to be a dividend,


for South African tax purposes, in terms of section 25BB of the Income Tax Act.


The dividend received by or accrued to South African tax residents must


be included in the gross income of such shareholders and will not be exempt


from income tax (in terms of the exclusion to the general dividend exemption,


contained in paragraph (aa) of section 10(1)(k)(i) of the Income Tax Act)


because it is a dividend distributed by a REIT. This dividend is, however,


exempt from dividend withholding tax in the hands of South African tax


resident shareholders, provided that the South African resident shareholders


provide the following forms to their CSDP or broker, as the case may be,


in respect of uncertificated shares, or the Company, in respect of


certificated shares:


a)  a declaration that the dividend is exempt from dividends tax; and


b)  a written undertaking to inform the CSDP, broker or the Company, as


the case may be, should the circumstances affecting the exemption change


or the beneficial owner ceases to be the beneficial owner, both in the


form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service.


Shareholders are advised to contact their CSDP, broker or the Company,


as the case may be, to arrange for the above-mentioned documents to be


submitted prior to payment of the dividend, if such documents have not


already been submitted.


Dividends received by non-resident shareholders will not be taxable as


income and instead will be treated as an ordinary dividend which is exempt


from income tax in terms of the general dividend exemption in


section 10(1)(k)(i) of the Income Tax Act. Any distribution received by


a non-resident from a REIT will be subject to dividend withholding tax


at 20%, unless the rate is reduced in terms of any applicable agreement


for the avoidance of double taxation ("DTA") between South Africa and the


country of residence of the shareholder. Assuming dividend withholding


tax will be withheld at a rate of 20%, the net dividend amount due to


non-resident shareholders is 196,57600 cents per share.


A reduced dividend withholding rate in terms of the applicable DTA may


only be relied on if the non-resident shareholder has provided


the following forms to their CSDP or broker, as the case may be, in


respect of uncertificated shares, or the Company, in respect of


certificated shares:


a)  a declaration that the dividend is subject to a reduced rate as a


result of the application of a DTA; and


b)  a written undertaking to inform their CSDP, broker or the Company,


as the case may be, should the circumstances affecting the reduced rate


change or the beneficial owner ceases to be the beneficial owner, both in


the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African Revenue


Service. Non-resident shareholders are advised to contact their CSDP,


broker or the Company, as the case may be, to arrange for the above-mentioned


documents to be submitted prior to payment of the dividend if such


documents have not already been submitted, if applicable.


Shares in issue at the date of declaration of this dividend: 365 204 738.


Resilient's income tax reference number: 9579269144.
