Quilter plc interim results for the period ended 30 June 2025 and Interim Dividend declaration


Quilter reports adjusted profit of £100 million and H1 2025 core net inflows of £4.5 billion representing


8% of opening AuMA (annualised)


Steven Levin, Chief Executive Officer, said:


"I'm pleased with our start to 2025. Flow momentum remains excellent with our Affluent and High Net Worth segments both outperforming


their market peers for level of inflows and growth as a percentage of opening assets. This clearly demonstrates the powerful nature of our


dual-distribution model. Our business has built on the momentum of the last two years, is in great shape and is continuing to deliver on the


growth opportunities ahead."


Highlights:


?      Total Assets under Management and Administration ("AuMA") increased by 6% since year end to £126.3 billion reflecting net inflows of £4.3 billion


       coupled with a positive contribution from markets despite US Dollar weakness over the period. Core net inflows of £4.5 billion represented an


       annualised 8% (H1 2024: 3%) of opening AuMA (7% reported after non-core net outflows).


?      Platform Assets under Administration ("AuA") increased by 8% to £92.0 billion since year-end. First half Platform net inflows of £4.2 billion (H1


       2024: £2.2 billion) were up 92% on the first half of 2024 and represented 10% (annualised) of opening AuA. Total assets under management by


       WealthSelect, the UK's largest Managed Portfolio Service ("MPS") reached £21.0 billion, an increase of 14% from December 2024.


?      The High Net Worth segment delivered a strong improvement in net inflows to 3% (annualised) of opening assets (H1 2024: 1%).


?      Adjusted profit before tax increased by 3% to £100 million (H1 2024: £97 million) with a percentage point improvement in the operating margin to


       30% (H1 2024: 29%).


?      Revenues grew by 2% to £337 million (H1 2024: £329 million) reflecting higher management fee revenue partially offset by lower investment


       revenue generated on shareholder funds. Cost control limited cost growth to 2%, taking the expense base to £237 million (H1 2024: £232 million).


?      Our Simplification programme has now achieved £43 million of savings on a run-rate basis, with the remaining £7 million of the £50 million target


       expected to be delivered, on a run-rate basis, by the end of 2025.


?      Adjusted diluted earnings per share of 5.4p increased by 4% (H1 2024: 5.2p), broadly in line with the increase in adjusted profit.


?      Net increase of 14 Quilter Restricted Financial Planners ("RFP's") to 1,454 and four Investment Managers to 180 since December 2024.


?      Ongoing Advice Review: Skilled Person Review submitted to the FCA with discussions now focused on the implementation of a likely remediation


       programme. Previously recognised provision remains appropriate.


?      Basic headline earnings per share of 3.4 pence (H1 2024: 1.0 pence).


?      Diluted headline earnings per share of 3.3 pence (H1 2024: 0.9 pence).


?      IFRS profit after tax of £46 million (H1 2024: £13 million).


?      Interim Dividend of 2.0 pence per share (H1 2024: 1.7 pence per share), representing an increase of 18%.


?      Solvency II ratio of 214% after payment of Interim Dividend (31 December 2024: 219%).

Financial review


Review of financial performance


Overview


The Group delivered solid growth in the first half of 2025, with adjusted profit before tax of £100 million, an increase of 3% on the prior period (H1 2024:


£97 million). This was supported by higher net management fees driven by increased average AuMA due to strong net inflows and positive markets,


and continued delivery of our Simplification programme. The Group's reported closing AuMA was £126.3 billion, a 6% increase on the opening position


(FY 2024: £119.4 billion). The AuMA increase of £6.9 billion is driven by net inflows of £4.3 billion and supported by market movements, including


currency movements, of £2.6 billion.


Alternative Performance Measures ("APMs")


We assess our financial performance using a variety of measures including APMs, as explained further on pages 15 to 17.


In the core business, net inflows of £4.5 billion increased by 160% against the prior period (H1 2024: £1.7 billion). This improvement reflected the


overall favourable macro environment, stronger investor confidence, and enhanced effectiveness in our distribution and proposition strategies. Core


gross flows increased 27% to £9.4 billion, (H1 2024: £7.4 billion), driven by higher activity of IFA channel flows onto the Platform. The increase reflects


growth in both the total advised platform market and our market share among IFA firms. Productivity, representing Quilter channel annualised gross


sales per Quilter Adviser, increased by 3% to £3.3 million (H1 2024: £3.2 million).


Within the Affluent segment:


?    Quilter channel: Gross flows of £2.1 billion were in line with the prior period, whilst net inflows of £1.3 billion increased 25% (H1 2024: £1.1 billion),


     demonstrating our continued strategic commitment to grow our Advice business. Annualised net inflows as a percentage of opening AuMA for


     the Quilter channel were 14% (H1 2024: 12%).


?    IFA channel: Gross flows of £5.7 billion onto the Quilter Platform increased by 49% (H1 2024: £3.8 billion). Net inflows of £2.9 billion were


     significantly higher than the prior period (H1 2024: £1.0 billion) reflecting both the breadth and strength of our proposition and distribution, and an


     increased market share of new business as we continued to win flows from competitors. Based on the latest Fundscape data (Q1 2025), the


     Platform continues to maintain the leading share of gross and net flows against our retail advised platform peers. Annualised net inflows as a


     percentage of opening AuMA for the IFA channel onto the Platform were 9% (H1 2024: 3%).


?    Funds via third-party platforms reported net outflows of £88 million, compared to £241 million of net outflows in the previous period.


Asset retention of 91% for the Affluent segment improved by 2 percentage points from the prior period (H1 2024: 89%).


Within the High Net Worth segment, gross flows of £1.5 billion were in line with the first half of 2024. Net inflows of £0.5 billion were meaningfully


ahead of the prior period (H1 2024: £0.1 billion), predominately driven by net inflows in the IFA and direct channel during the first half of 2025 and the


loss of a large value low margin account in the prior period. Asset retention of 93% for the High Net Worth segment was 4 percentage points ahead of


the previous period (H1 2024: 89%).


The Group's core business AuMA of £123.4 billion is 6% ahead of the opening position (FY 2024: £116.3 billion) reflecting positive market movements


of £2.6 billion and net inflows of £4.5 billion. The Affluent core segment AuMA increased by 7% to £95.0 billion (FY 2024: £88.5 billion), of which £32.0


billion is managed by Quilter, versus the opening position of £29.5 billion. The High Net Worth segment AuM was £30.0 billion, up 2% from the opening


position of £29.5 billion, with all assets managed by Quilter.


In total, £61.7 billion, representing 50% of core business AuMA, is managed by Quilter across the Group (FY 2024: £58.5 billion, 50%).


The Group's revenue margin of 42 bps was 3 bps lower than the prior period (H1 2024: 45 bps).


In the Affluent segment, the administered revenue margin was 23 bps, 2 bps lower than the prior period (H1 2024: 25 bps). This is primarily the result


of the impact from our tiered pricing structure and is consistent with our expectations. The managed revenue margin decreased by 2 bps to 35 bps (H1


2024: 37 bps). As anticipated, within our Managed Solutions the proportion of total client assets invested in the Cirilium Active range, our highest


revenue bps contributor, remained in net outflow as advisers continued to favour Managed Portfolio Services ("MPS") for their clients. Reflecting this


ongoing shift towards managed solutions on platforms, WealthSelect remains the largest MPS offering in the industry and continues to grow with AuMA


of £21.0 billion as at 30 June 2025 (FY 2024: £18.4 billion).


The revenue margin in the High Net Worth segment decreased by 4 bps to 67 bps (H1 2024: 71 bps), primarily due to a shift to MPS solutions and


change in asset mix.


Adjusted profit before tax increased by 3% to £100 million (H1 2024: £97 million). Net management fees of £257 million increased 5% (H1 2024:


£245 million) primarily due to an increase in reported average AuMA compared to the prior period of 11% to £122.1 billion (H1 2024: £110.0 billion),


partially offset by the reductions in net management fee margins largely reflecting the changes in the High Net Worth and Affluent Solutions asset mix


and lower Platform margins in line with our guidance.


Interest revenue generated from client funds included within net management fees were £14 million (H1 2024: £16 million) reflecting the reduction in


interest rates compared to the prior period. Other revenue of £48 million, which mainly comprise our share of income from providing advice, was


broadly in line with the prior period (H1 2024: £47 million). Investment revenue, predominantly interest income generated on shareholder cash and


capital resources of £32 million, decreased by £5 million (H1 2024: £37 million) due to lower average interest rates in the first half of 2025 compared


to the prior period.


Operating expenses of £237 million increased by 2% on the prior period (H1 2024: £232 million) as a result of inflationary and National Insurance


increases, higher FSCS levies and planned business investment, partially offset by Simplification cost savings. The Group operating margin improved


by 1 percentage point to 30% (H1 2024: 29%).


The Group's IFRS profit after tax was £46 million compared to £13 million in H1 2024. This primarily reflects variances in policyholder tax outcomes


in the prior period.


Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 4% to 5.4 pence (H1 2024: 5.2 pence).
