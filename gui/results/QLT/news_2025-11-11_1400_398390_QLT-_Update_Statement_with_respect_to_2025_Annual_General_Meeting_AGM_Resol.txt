  Update Statement with respect to 2025 Annual General Meeting ("AGM") Resolution Vote


At our AGM held on 22 May 2025, resolution 16, which sought authorisation for political donations or


expenditure, passed with the requisite majority of votes. However, 22.28% of the votes cast were


against the resolution.


As we reported following the 2024 AGM, there was a significant difference in voting between the South


African and UK share registers on this resolution, with support levels of 62.07% and 96.61%


respectively. In accordance with provision 4 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have continued


to directly engage with our largest South African shareholders on this resolution to further understand


their views. We believe that this dialogue has helped clarify the purpose of this resolution in the UK.


We continue to recognise that any linkage between business and politics is sensitive in the current


South African governance context.


Quilter has not made, and has no intention to make, any political donations. Like other listed UK


companies, we seek authority for political donations and expenditure up to an aggregate amount of


£50,000 to avoid any inadvertent breaches of UK company law given the breadth of the applicable


provisions. The Board understands the importance of maintaining effective communication with our


shareholders and is committed to ensuring clarity on the purpose of this authority, which is simply a


precautionary measure to ensure that the Company and its subsidiaries do not inadvertently breach


UK company law in any jurisdiction. As in previous years, we will continue to explain clearly in the 2026


Notice of AGM the reasons why the Board believes this resolution is an important protection for the


Company.
