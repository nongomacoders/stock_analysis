MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER


OVERVIEW


Harmony delivered a solid operational performance in Q1FY26, driven by an improvement in safety, consistent


operational excellence, higher recovered grades at Hidden Valley and a higher gold price received. We are


encouraged to report a loss?of?life?free quarter ? affirming that safe mines are profitable mines. As we continue


Mining with Purpose, Harmony is on track to meet its FY26 production, cost and grade guidance.


While gold remains our core focus, our copper expansion is a strategic move to enhance portfolio resilience, margin


quality and long?term sustainability. On 24 October 2025, we completed the acquisition of MAC Copper, owner of


the high?grade CSA mine in Cobar, Australia. We are delighted to welcome the CSA mine employees to Harmony.


The completion of this landmark acquisition marks a significant milestone in our strategy to grow into a global gold


and copper producer. Copper is essential to the global shift toward renewable energy infrastructure. Harmony's


growing copper portfolio reinforces our strategic role in enabling the energy transition, while positioning us to


benefit from long?term structural demand.


Whether investing in our own growth projects or pursuing value?accretive mergers and acquisitions, all


opportunities are assessed through a disciplined lens that weighs potential returns against associated risks.


Ultimately, every project competes for capital, and we will continue to allocate resources to those initiatives that


deliver the greatest value for our stakeholders.


Safety


The health and safety of our people remain our top priority. Our long?term improvement in our safety performance


reflects the success of our proactive programmes and robust safety infrastructure. As operators of some of


the world's deepest mines, we know this demands excellence at all times. We remain committed to zero harm


through a culture of accountability and continuous improvement.


In Q1FY26, our lost?time injury frequency rate improved to 4.29 from 5.57 in Q1FY25 ? a positive trend, but the


elimination of injuries and zero harm remains the goal. We continue embedding a safety?first mindset across all


operations, ensuring every workplace is safe, compliant, and empowering.


Other notable achievements this reporting period include:


?  South African operations achieved 3 million loss?of?life free shifts for the period under review


?  Five of our underground mines achieved millionaire status during the quarter, with Masimong recording over


   four million loss?of?life free shifts


?  Hidden Valley has operated for over 10 years without a loss of life.


Revenue and average gold price received


Gold revenue for the quarter rose 20% to R21 689 million (US$1 230 million) from R18 125 million


(US$1 009 million) in Q1FY25, driven primarily by a 34% increase in the average gold price to R1 818 510/kg


(US$3 209/oz) from R1 360 974/kg (US$2 356/oz).


While the gold price remains outside our control, we continue to focus on factors within our influence: improving


safety, maintaining disciplined mining practices, allocating capital effectively and sustaining rigorous cost


management.


Production


We remain on track to meet full?year production guidance. In line with plan, group production for Q1FY26 declined


8% to 12 128kg (389 923oz) compared to 13 131kg (422 172oz) in Q1FY25. Doornkop's production declined


year?on?year as a result of shaft water?handling constraints, which have now been resolved. Production at Moab


Khotsong declined by 20% year?on?year due to challenging ground conditions and fluctuating face grades as we


mine out the middle mine, as planned.


Compared to Q4FY25, production increased quarter?on?quarter by 6%, driven by an 8% rise in total tonnes milled


and improved operational momentum across the portfolio.


Recovered grades


While underground recovered grades decreased by 6% to 5.91g/t from 6.32g/t in the comparable reporting period,


this is in line with plan, and we remain ahead of the guided 5.80g/t for FY26.


Recovered grades at Mponeng remained steady at 10.54g/t compared to 10.70g/t in Q1FY25.


Hidden Valley continues to deliver exceptional results with recovered grades increasing by 31% to 1.63g/t from


1.24g/t in Q1FY25.


Balance sheet and hedging


Our balance sheet remains strong, with net cash increasing by 53% in the first quarter to R17.1 billion


(US$989 million) from R11.1 billion (US$628 million) as at 30 June 2025. Liquidity also improved, with cash and


available undrawn facilities rising 27% to R26.6 billion (US$1.5 billion) since 30 June 2025. This performance


reflects robust operating free cash flow, margin improvements across all operations, and the benefit of a high rand


gold price, reinforcing our financial flexibility to support growth and resilience.


The acquisition of MAC Copper has been successfully funded through a combination of cash, existing credit


facilities and a US$1.25 billion bridge loan. We have drawn down only 70%, or US$875 million from the bridge


facility, and elected to fund the balance of the acquisition price and related costs from cash balances.


Following the completion of the transaction, our net debt to EBITDA ratio remains comfortably below our internal


threshold of 1.0x, underscoring our disciplined approach to capital management and balance sheet strength. The


structure of debt instruments used to fund our major projects is under review and will enable Harmony to optimise


its balance sheet while matching its funding profile to its cash flow generation. We will provide further guidance at


our H1FY26 results update.


We remain well positioned to advance our life?of?mine extension projects in South Africa and at Hidden Valley,


while integrating the CSA mine into the Harmony portfolio. In parallel, we continue to advance Eva Copper and


remain fully committed to permitting Wafi?Golpu ? our transformational copper?gold growth projects.


Our confidence in future cash flows, combined with a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation,


places us in a strong position to deliver shareholder returns while pursuing long?term growth.


The record gold prices have provided an excellent opportunity to replace maturing hedges with new ones as


they expire, locking in excellent margins in?line with our hedging policy. During the quarter, the gold hedge book


was maintained at between 10% and 30% of production over a rolling 36?month period. The average floor and


ceiling price on our rand gold zero cost collar book of 484 000oz stood at R1 820 000/kg and R2 062 000/kg


respectively. The longer dated maturities reflect higher protection levels being locked in off the recently higher spot


gold price.


Costs


Costs remain well controlled, with increases aligned to plan and below mining inflation, reflecting disciplined


cost management.


Total cash operating costs, net of by?product credits, increased by 6% to R11 260 million (US$639 million) from


R10 673 million, mainly due to higher royalties, increased contractor costs and annual electricity inflation. Royalty


payments in South Africa are calculated on a sliding scale based on both revenue and profitability. During Q1FY26,


these royalties increased to R716 million (US$41 million), representing 6% of total cash operating costs, compared


to R496 million (US$28 million), or 4% of total cash operating costs in the comparable reporting period.


Cash operating cost per kilogram increased 14% year?on?year to R928 439/kg (US$1 638/oz) from R812 811/kg


(US$1 407/oz), mainly due to lower planned production alongside the above?mentioned increases.


Year?on?year, AISC rose 15% to R1 107 486/kg (US$1 954/oz) from R963 310/kg (US$1 667/oz) in Q1FY25.


This is in line with guidance and reflects the increase in sustaining capital as previously guided. Sequentially, AISC


increased by only 3% compared to Q4FY25, supported by higher tonnes milled and improved production.


Hidden Valley delivered a standout performance, reducing its AISC by 16% to R773 566/kg (US$1 365/oz). The


improved recovered grades and enhanced operational efficiency were key drivers of the performance alongside


higher silver prices and resultant increase in by?product credits.


All?in costs (AIC) increased by 19% to R1 218 721/kg (US$2 150/oz) from R1 026 004/kg (US$1 776/oz) in


Q1FY25 due to the investment in our major projects.


Capital expenditure and projects


Group capital expenditure rose 31% to R2 873 million (US$163 million) from R2 191 million, reflecting investment


in high?return, long?life projects and ongoing development capital across our underground mines to maintain


flexibility. The increase was primarily due to the life?of?mine extensions at Mponeng, Moab Khotsong and Hidden


Valley, as well as the 100MW solar project at Moab Khotsong to reduce long?term energy costs, derisk energy


supply and lower our carbon footprint. Construction of the 100MW solar plant remains on track for completion by


the end of calendar year 2026, moving us closer to our net carbon?zero target by 2045. A 10 megalitre per day


feed capacity reverse osmosis water treatment plant at Tau Tona was commissioned in July 2025, contributing to


our 2034 water ambition target.


While contractor and trackless mobile machinery challenges have delayed progress at Mponeng and Moab


Khotsong, these timelines are incorporated into our life?of?mine plans. Studies have also commenced at Tshepong


North to determine the feasibility of extending mine life by approximately six years.


Our disciplined capital deployment strategy focuses on projects that deliver solid returns and sustainable long?term


value, positioning Harmony to fund growth initiatives such as Eva Copper while maintaining financial strength.


MAC Copper acquisition


CSA is a long?life, mechanised underground copper mine located in a Tier?1 mining jurisdiction. This asset will


meaningfully enhance our business and support our long?term growth.


Harmony's FY27 planning parameters will be integrated into the CSA life?of?mine planning process, ensuring


alignment with the disciplined and consistent approach applied across our broader portfolio.


OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE


Our operations are grouped into four distinct quadrants, each with its own plan, risk profile and strategy.


This ensures we deliver as guided, and extract the absolute best from our assets. Our overall operational


performance this quarter was supported by continued exceptional performances at Mponeng and Hidden Valley.


South African underground high?grade operations


Adjusted free cash flows from Mponeng and Moab Khotsong increased by 3% to R2 819 million (US$160 million)


from R2 729 million (US$152 million) in Q1FY25. The performance was underpinned by another strong


operational performance from Mponeng where adjusted free cash flows increased by 23% to R2 257 million


(US$128 million) from R1 842 million (US$103 million) in the comparable quarter. Production declined by 14%


to 4 211kg mainly as a result of lower recovered grades at Moab Khotsong which declined by 18% to 7.25g/t from


8.84g/t year on year. Mponeng's recovered grades remained high and steady at 10.54g/t.

INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS


Eva Copper


The Eva Copper Project (Eva Copper or the Project) in northwest Queensland continues to progress well.


Preliminary site works are underway, supported by a conditional grant from the Queensland Government.


The feasibility study update is largely complete, with front?end engineering and design advancing. We are


engaging with the Queensland Government to secure a power solution aligned with both the Project's needs and


the state's long?term energy roadmap.


Eva Copper's designation as a Prescribed Project supports our application to amend its Environmental Authority.


Upon completion of the feasibility update, expected before the end of the 2025 calendar year, Harmony's Board


will consider a Final Investment Decision.


Current declared Mineral Resources stand at 366Mt @ 0.4% Cu (1.47Mt copper) and 196Mt @ 0.07g/t Au


(440 000oz gold), reinforcing Eva Copper's scale and strategic importance.


Wafi?Golpu


Discussions between Harmony, our joint venture partner Newmont Corporation and the Papua New Guinea


Government to secure the special mining lease are continuing.


ANNUAL PRODUCTION, COST AND GRADE GUIDANCE


While we are only one quarter into FY26, we are confident of achieving our annual guidance of:


-   1 400 000 to 1 500 000oz in total production


-   AISC of between R1 150 000/kg to R1 220 000/kg


-   underground grade of above 5.80g/t


Updated production guidance, including forecasts for CSA mine and its contribution, will be provided with the


release of the interim results scheduled for late February or early March 2026.


CONCLUSION


An improving safety culture, balanced capital allocation, operational flexibility and stringent cost controls remain


the foundation of our commitment to long?term value creation for shareholders and stakeholders.


Our strategy remains gold?first, with copper as a complementary metal. We continue to unlock value through


reserve conversion and disciplined, value?accretive mergers and acquisitions. Harmony's 136Moz Mineral


Resource and 37Moz Mineral Reserve base support a stable gold production profile of 1.4Moz to 1.5Moz


annually for over 20 years. Reserve conversion opportunities, especially at current gold prices, offer further


upside. The integration of CSA mine and advancement of Eva Copper will strengthen medium?term resilience ?


timeously mitigating the Moab Khotsong ore gap.


Pending the approval of Eva Copper, copper production of approximately 100 000 tonnes per year is expected


within three to five years, enhancing margins and diversifying cash flow.


We remain focused on delivering consistent, long?term returns while building a resilient and future?ready


portfolio.


Thank you.

HARMONY'S ANNUAL REPORTS


Harmony's Integrated Report, and its report suite filed on a Form 20F with the United States'


Securities and Exchange Commission for the financial year ended 30 June 2025, are available on our


website (www.harmony.co.za/invest).


FORWARD?LOOKING STATEMENTS


This booklet contains forward?looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbour provided by Section 21E of the Exchange


Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), with respect to our financial condition,


results of operations, business strategies, operating efficiencies, competitive positions, growth opportunities for existing services,


plans and objectives of management, markets for stock and other matters. These forward?looking statements, including, among


others, those relating to our future business prospects, revenues, and the potential benefit of acquisitions (including statements


regarding growth and cost savings) wherever they may occur in this booklet, are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment


of our senior management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from


those suggested by the forward?looking statements. As a consequence, these forward?looking statements should be considered in


light of various important factors, including those set forth in our integrated annual report. All statements other than statements


of historical facts included in this booklet may be forward?looking statements. By their nature, forward?looking statements involve


risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances and should be considered in light of various important


factors, including those set forth in this disclaimer. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. Important


factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward?looking statements


include, without limitation: overall economic and business conditions in South Africa, Papua New Guinea, Australia and elsewhere;


the impact from, and measures taken to address, Covid?19 and other contagious diseases, such as HIV and tuberculosis; high and


rising inflation, supply chain issues, volatile commodity costs and other inflationary pressures exacerbated by the geopolitical risks;


estimates of future earnings, and the sensitivity of earnings to gold and other metals prices; estimates of future gold and other


metals production and sales; estimates of future cash costs; estimates of future cash flows, and the sensitivity of cash flows to gold


and other metals prices; estimates of provision for silicosis settlement; increasing regulation of environmental and sustainability


matters such as greenhouse gas emission and climate change, and the impact of climate change on our operations; estimates of


future tax liabilities under the Carbon Tax Act (South Africa); statements regarding future debt repayments; estimates of future capital


expenditures; the success of our business strategy, exploration and development activities and other initiatives; future financial


position, plans, strategies, objectives, capital expenditures, projected costs and anticipated cost savings and financing plans; estimates


of reserves statements regarding future exploration results and the replacement of reserves; the ability to achieve anticipated


efficiencies and other cost savings in connection with, and the ability to successfully integrate, past and future acquisitions, as


well as at existing operations; our ability to complete ongoing and future acquisitions; fluctuations in the market price of gold and


other metals; the occurrence of hazards associated with underground and surface gold mining; the occurrence of labour disruptions


related to industrial action or health and safety incidents; power cost increases as well as power stoppages, fluctuations and usage


constraints; ageing infrastructure, unplanned breakdowns and stoppages that may delay production, increase costs and industrial


accidents; supply chain shortages and increases in the prices of production imports and the availability, terms and deployment of


capital; our ability to hire and retain senior management, sufficiently technically?skilled employees, as well as our ability to achieve


sufficient representation of historically disadvantaged persons in management positions or sufficient gender diversity in management


positions or at Board level; our ability to comply with requirements that we operate in a sustainable manner and provide benefits to


affected communities; potential liabilities related to occupational health diseases; changes in government regulation and the political


environment, particularly tax and royalties, mining rights, health, safety, environmental regulation and business ownership including


any interpretation thereof; court decisions affecting the mining industry, including, without limitation, regarding the interpretation


of mining rights; our ability to protect our information technology and communication systems and the personal data we retain;


risks related to the failure of internal controls; the outcome of pending or future litigation or regulatory proceedings; fluctuations


in exchange rates and currency devaluations and other macroeconomic monetary policies, as well as the impact of South African


exchange control regulations; the adequacy of the Group's insurance coverage; any further downgrade of South Africa's credit rating


and socio?economic or political instability in South Africa, Papua New Guinea, Australia and other countries in which we operate;


changes in technical and economic assumptions underlying our mineral reserves estimates; geotechnical challenges due to the ageing


of certain mines and a trend toward mining deeper pits and more complex, often deeper underground, deposits; and actual or alleged


breach or breaches in governance processes, fraud, bribery or corruption at our operations that leads to censure, penalties or negative


reputational impacts.


The foregoing factors and others described under "Risk Factors" in our Integrated Annual Report (www.har.co.za) and our Form 20?F


should not be construed as exhaustive. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward?


looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this annual report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated


events, except as required by law. All subsequent written or oral forward?looking statements attributable to Harmony or any person


acting on its behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements herein. Any forward?looking statements contained in these financial


results have not been reviewed or reported on by Harmony's external auditors.


Competent Person's statement

is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the statement, in the case of Mineral
