Notice of Final Gross Cash Dividend


Our dividend declaration for the 12 months ended 30 June 2025 is as follows:


Declaration of final gross cash ordinary dividend no. 97


The Board has approved, and notice is hereby given, that a final gross cash


dividend of 155 SA cents (8.88252 US cents*) per ordinary share in respect of the


12 months ended 30 June 2025, has been declared payable to the registered


shareholders of Harmony on Monday, 13 October 2025.


In accordance with paragraphs 11.17(a)(i) to (x) and 11.17(c) of the JSE Listings


Requirements the following additional information is disclosed:


  ? The dividend has been declared out of income reserves;


  ? The local Dividend Withholding Tax rate is 20%;


  ? The gross local dividend amount is 155.00000 SA cents


    (8.88252 US cents*) per ordinary share for shareholders exempt from the


    Dividend Withholding Tax;


  ? The net local dividend amount is 124.00000 SA cents per ordinary


    share for shareholders liable to pay the Dividend Withholding Tax;


  ? Harmony currently has 634 767 724 ordinary shares in issue (which


    includes 12 215 564 treasury shares); and


  ? Harmony's income tax reference number is 9240/012/60/0.


A dividend No. 97 of 155.00000 SA cents (8.88252 US cents*) per ordinary share,


being the dividend for the 12 months ended 30 June 2025, has been declared payable


on Monday, 13 October 2025 to those shareholders recorded in the share register of


the company at the close of business on Friday, 10 October 2025. The dividend is


declared in the currency of the Republic of South Africa. Any change in address or


dividend instruction to apply to this dividend must be received by the company's


transfer secretaries or registrar not later than Friday, 3 October 2025.


Dividends received by non-resident shareholders will be exempt from income tax in


terms of section 10(1)(k)(i) of the Income Tax Act. The dividends withholding tax


rate is 20%, accordingly, any dividend will be subject to dividend withholding tax


levied at a rate of 20%, unless the rate is reduced in terms of any applicable


agreement for the avoidance of double taxation (DTA) between South Africa and the


country of residence of the shareholder.


Should dividend withholding tax be withheld at a rate of 20%, the net dividend


amount due to non-resident shareholders is 124.00000 SA cents per share. A reduced


dividend withholding rate in terms of the applicable DTA may only be relied on if


the non-resident shareholder has provided the following forms to their Central


Securities Depository Participant (CSDP) or broker, as the case may be in respect


of uncertificated shares or the company, in respect of certificated shares:


 (a)   a declaration that the dividend is subject to a reduced rate as a result of


       the application of a DTA; and


 (b)   a written undertaking to inform the CSDP or broker, as the case may be,


       should the circumstances affecting the reduced rate change or the beneficial


       owner cease to be the beneficial owner,


 both in the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the South African Revenue


 Service. Non-resident shareholders are advised to contact their CSDP or broker, as


 the case may be, to arrange for the abovementioned documents to be submitted prior


 to the payment of the distribution if such documents have not already been


 submitted.


 In compliance with the requirements of Strate Proprietary Limited (Strate) and


 the JSE Listings Requirements, the salient dates for payment of the dividend are


 as follows:

 dividend is                                            Tuesday, 7 October 2025

 date for currency conversion.


* Based on an exchange rate of R17.45/US$1 at 22 August 2025. However, the actual


  rate of payment will depend on the exchange rate on the date for currency


  conversion.
