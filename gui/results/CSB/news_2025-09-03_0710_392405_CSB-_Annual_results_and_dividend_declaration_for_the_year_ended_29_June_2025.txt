COMPANY PROFILE


Cashbuild is southern Africa's leading retailer of quality building materials and associated products, selling


direct to a predominantly cash-paying customer base through its chain of 318 stores at reporting date.


Cashbuild carries an in-depth quality product range tailored to the specific needs of the communities it


serves. Its customers are typically home-builders and improvers, contractors, farmers, traders, as well as


all other customers requiring quality building materials at the best value.




Cashbuild has built its credibility and reputation by consistently offering its customers quality building


materials at the best value through a purchasing and inventory policy that ensures customers' requirements


are always met.




FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS


Revenue for the year increased by 3% impacted by the 53rd week reported in the prior year. Comparing to


the previously audited and pro-forma 52 weeks information, the growth is 5%. Revenue for stores in


existence prior to July 2023 (pre-existing stores - 304 stores) increased by 2% and the 14 new stores


contributed 1% growth. Transactions through the tills increased by 4%. Selling price inflation was 1.7%


at the end of June 2025. Gross profit increased by 2% with gross profit margin percentage increasing from


24.7% to 24.8%.




Operating expenses decreased by 3% impacted by prior year impairment of R137 million of goodwill and


trade marks in P&L Hardware and an extra week's expenses included in the 53rd week of the prior year.


Adjusting for the impairment and 53rd week expenses, the growth is 5%, with existing stores contributing


4% and new stores 1%.




The effective tax rate of 26.5% (June 2024: 36.6%) for the year is lower than the prior year, mainly impacted


by the non-tax deductible impairment of the P&L Hardware goodwill in the prior year.




Basic earnings per share increased by more than 100% whilst headline earnings per share increased by 10%.




Cash and short-term funds increased to R1.9 billion due to June 2025 suppliers' payments processed in


July 2025, in contrast to the prior year where the payments were processed in June 2024. Stock levels,


including new stores have increased by 7% with stock days increasing from prior year to 96 days (2024:


90 days). Net asset value per share increased by 4% to 7 996 cents (2024: 7 667 cents).




During the year, the Group opened 8 new stores (7 Cashbuild and 1 P&L Hardware) and closed 12


(1 Cashbuild and 11 P&L Hardware) under-performing stores. The Group further refurbished 26 Cashbuild


stores and relocated 1 P&L Hardware store. Cashbuild will continue its store expansion, relocation, and


refurbishment strategy in a controlled manner, through its feasibility process. The opening of the Cashbuild


Small Model Stores (SMS) remains on track.




PROSPECTS


Group revenue for the 7 weeks subsequent to period end is 6% higher than the prior year's comparative 7


week period. Management expects trading conditions to remain challenging. This information has not been


reviewed or audited by the Company's auditor.
