REVIEWED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR


ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025 AND CASH DIVIDEND DECLARATION


1.   SALIENT FEATURES


     Revenue increased by 10% to R4,291 million from R3,913 million in the prior


     corresponding period.


     Fund management earnings per share, excluding the impact of the SARS matter,


     amounted to 452.2 cents per share, an increase of 12% from 402.9 cents per share in the


     prior corresponding period.


     Gross total dividends per share decreased by 20% to 454.0 cents per share, from 566.0


     cents per share in the prior corresponding period.


     Fund management earnings are used by management to measure operating financial


     performance, which excludes the net impact of fair value gains and losses and related


     foreign exchange movements on investment securities held for seeding products. Fund


     management earnings per share decreased by 26% to 454.0 cents per share from 617.1


     cents per share in the prior corresponding period. Headline earnings per share and


     earnings per share decreased by 25% to 474.3 cents per share, from 630.5 cents per


     share in the prior corresponding period. This is due to the once off impact of the successful


     outcome of the SARS matter, wherein the tax provision raised during the 2023 financial


     year was reversed and included as income in that period.

     The directors resolved to declare a final gross dividend of 254.0 cents (2024: 228.0 cents)


     per share from income reserves in respect of the year ended 30 September 2025. The


     dividend amount, net of South African dividend tax of 20%, is 203.2 cents (2024: 182.4


     cents) per share for those shareholders who are not exempt from dividend tax. The


     number of ordinary shares in issue at the declaration date is 349 592 298 and the number


     of the subscription shares (being the shares issued to the BEE Trusts in the 2024 B-BBEE


     transaction) in issue is 37 567 515, which attracts a 10% trickle dividend. The income tax


     number of the Company is 9 675 107 719.


     The salient dates of the dividend declaration are:
