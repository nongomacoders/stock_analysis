                 Extracts from Financial Report for the Half Year Ended 30 June 2025


Kore Potash, the potash development company with 97%-ownership of the Kola and DX Potash Projects


in the Sintoukola Basin, located within the Republic of Congo ("RoC"), today reports its unaudited


financial results and operational highlights for the half year ended 30 June 2025 ("the Period").


The full financial report is available online at the Company's website at https://korepotash.com/wp-


content/uploads/2025/09/Half-Year-Report-June-2025.pdf. The financial statements contained within


this announcement should be read in conjunction with the notes contained within the full financial


report.


Highlights


 ? Optimised DFS was announced on 27 February 2025. Unlike the DFS and the Optimisation Study,


      the Optimised DFS is based on a production period which utilizes all Proved and Probable Ore


      Reserves and only 6% of Inferred Minerals Resources, giving a LoM of 23 years. The prior DFS and


      Optimisation Study disclosures included an additional 20% of Inferred Mineral Resources after the


      Ore Reserves were depleted. Kore Potash considers there is strong potential for the mine plan on


      which this Optimised DFS is based to be extended beyond 23 years by upgrading a portion of the


      340Mt of Inferred Mineral Resources to Measured or Indicated Resources through further


      exploration during the 23 years of operations.


 ? On 27 February 2025, the Company also announced a restatement of the Mineral Resource


      estimate for the Kola deposit. No material changes were made to the original Mineral Resource


      estimate dated 6 July 2017.


 ? Successful completion of USD10 million fundraise as announced on 21 March 2025 with a further


      USD500K conditionally raised subject to shareholders approval and subsequently approved by


      shareholders at a General Meeting held on 11 June 2025.


 ? Following a recommendation from the Company's Remuneration and Nomination Committee, the


      Board resolved to grant options to the Company's Non-Executive Directors. While this is not


      compliant with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the committees considered this appropriate


      for the group considering the contribution made by the individuals, the stage of the company's


      lifecycle and to conserve cash. On 22 April 2025:


         o the Company granted options over 4,000,000 new Ordinary Shares to the Company's Non-


             Executive Directors.


         o the Company granted options over 2,000,000 new Ordinary Shares to the Company's


           Chairman.


         o the Company also granted options over 9,000,000 new Ordinary Shares which were reported


           as issued in June 2022 and subsequently approved by shareholders at the AGM dated 11 June


           2025 as the vesting conditions were successfully met.


      These were subsequently approved by shareholders at a General Meeting held on 11 June 2025.


 ?   On 10 June 2025, the Company announced that it signed non-binding Term Sheets for availing the


     total funding requirement for the Kola Project with OWI-RAMS GMBH. Pursuant to the non-binding


      Term Sheets, OWI-RAMS GMBH has indicated its intention to arrange and then provide a funding


      package for the Kola Project, amounting to approximately USD2.2 billion, through a blend of senior


      secured project finance and royalty financing.


?    The Company held its Annual General Meeting on 11 June 2025, at which all resolutions were duly


      passed.


?    Net operating loss after tax for the 6 months ended 30 June 2025 was USD435,428 (H1 2024:


      USD528,636).


?    Cash and cash equivalents held at 30 June 2025 was USD3,499,143 (31 Dec 2024: USD1,339,321).


?     The exploration and evaluation assets at 30 June 2025 were USD196,123,524, an increase of


     USD26,775,654 from USD169,347,870 at 31 December 2024. During the Period the Company


      capitalised USD6,368,341 in exploration and evaluation expenditure and further the expenditure


      increased by USD20,407,313 as a result of the weakening of the USD against the currency of the


      RoC.
