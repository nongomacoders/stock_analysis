"The JSE delivered a strong first-half performance, with net profit after tax up 13.2% to R557.8 million. Growth was driven by elevated equity market


activity and consistent execution across our core business lines.


Capital Markets, Post-Trade and Information Services each delivered solid revenue gains, reinforcing the strength of our established businesses and the


improved quality of earnings stemming from a more diversified revenue base. While newer segments remain in their build phase, they are aligned to long-term


demand and progressing in line with expectations.


Our infrastructure modernisation programme is ahead of schedule, with key BDA milestones delivered. Backed by a strong balance sheet, an expanding product and


data offering, and a disciplined investment approach, the JSE is well-positioned to advance its strategic agenda in the second half."


- Leila Fourie, Group CEO


Overview of results


Net profit after tax (NPAT) increased by 13.2% to R557.8 million. Headline earnings per share (HEPS) increased by 13.4% year-on-year (YoY) to 687.0 cents.


The Group continues to be cash-generative, with net cash generated from operations of R518.2 million (2024: R502.6 million), up by 3.1%.


The Group's operating income was up by 11.4% to R1.71 billion, primarily supported by equity market revenues in Capital Markets and Post-Trade Services.


Most business segments reported growth in revenue for the period, with Capital Markets revenue up by 16% and Post-Trade Services up by 17% YoY, and


Information Services up by 5%. JIS revenue declined by 11% as a result of lower interest rates and a margin income adjustment in the prior year


Total operating expenditure increased by 7.5% YoY to R1.09 billion, demonstrating a disciplined approach to cost management amid increased trade-related


costs.1.56% of the increase in OPEX relates to costs linked to higher trading activity.


Capital expenditure of R27 million (2024: R29 million) remains focused on protecting the core business, as well as growing new business lines.


The Group maintains a robust balance sheet and cash position of R2.5 billion as at 30 June 2025 (including bond investments of R448 million). Ring-fenced


and non-distributable cash and bonds (regulatory capital and investor protection funds) amounted to R1.31 billion.
