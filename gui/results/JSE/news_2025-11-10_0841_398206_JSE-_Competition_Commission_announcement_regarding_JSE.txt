COMPETITION COMMISSION ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING JSE


Shareholders are advised that the Competition Commission (the "Commission")


has announced on social media on 9 November 2025 that it has referred the


JSE to the Competition Tribunal (the "Tribunal") for prosecution. The


Commission did not provide details in its announcement and posted a non-


confidential version of its referral affidavit, which it referred to the


Tribunal on 1 October 2025.


The JSE is preparing its plea to the Commission's referral, which, by


agreement with the Commission and with the consent of the Tribunal, will


be filed in early 2026.


Given the nature of these proceedings, the JSE cannot determine if or when


the matter will proceed to trial.


The referral arises from a complaint that A2X Proprietary Limited (A2X)


submitted to the Commission in October 2022, alleging that the JSE is


abusing a dominant market position by engaging in exclusionary conduct


concerning the JSE's broker dealer accounting (BDA) system and matched


principal (MP) trade type. The JSE has cooperated fully with the Commission


throughout its investigation. The JSE denies these allegations in the


strongest possible terms and has been advised by external legal counsel


that the Commission's claims are without merit.


The Commission's referral seeks an order from the Tribunal that the JSE


amend its rules relating to the BDA system and the MP trade type, as well


as a potential administrative penalty.
