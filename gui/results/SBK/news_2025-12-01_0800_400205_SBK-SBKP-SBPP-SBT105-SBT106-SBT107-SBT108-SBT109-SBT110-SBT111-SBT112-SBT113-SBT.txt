Voluntary trading update for the ten months to 31 October 2025


Standard Bank Group's performance trends in the ten months to 31 October 2025 (10M25)


were broadly in line with those reported in the first half of the year (1H25). The group's


guidance for the year ended 31 December 2025 (FY25), as provided in August 2025,


remains unchanged.


Operating environment


Despite geopolitical and trade policy uncertainty, global economic activity has been relatively


resilient year to date. Inflation and interest rates have declined.


On average, across the portfolio of countries in which the group operates in sub-Saharan


Africa, inflation has eased, and interest rates have declined. While macroeconomic reforms


and stabilisation efforts have brought relative stability, particularly in Nigeria, Angola and


Ghana, sovereign stress has remained elevated in Malawi and increased in Mozambique.


In South Africa, inflation and interest rates have also declined year to date. Real gross


domestic product (GDP) growth has been subdued, but confidence appears to be improving.


In November 2025, the finance minister announced the new inflation target of 3% (previously


3 to 6 percent) and the South African Reserve Bank Monetary Policy Committee cut interest


rates by 25 basis points (bps). This brings the cumulative interest rate cuts for the year to


100 bps.


10M25 performance


Banking revenue grew by mid-to-high single digits in 10M25 compared to the ten months to


31 October 2024 (period on period). Net interest income growth was driven by book growth,


supported by continued strong origination in Investment Banking. This was partly offset by


the negative endowment impact from lower average interest rates. Non-interest revenue


growth remained robust. A larger and more engaged client base, combined with increased


client activity, led to strong net fee and commission revenue growth. Continued uncertainty


and market volatility supported strong trading revenue momentum.


Despite an increase in activity-related costs, cost growth remained well contained. Banking


revenue growth was slightly ahead of cost growth.


The group's credit loss ratio for 10M25 was around the middle on the group's through-the-


cycle range of 70 to 100 basis points. Corporate & Investment Banking credit impairment


charges were higher period on period, off a low base in the prior period. Personal and


Private Banking credit impairment charges were lower period on period due to a slowdown in


early arrears formation and lower inflows into non-performing loans as reported previously.


Business & Commercial Banking credit impairment charges were also lower period on


period, driven by improvements in both South Africa and Africa Regions.


The Insurance and Asset Management franchise continued to deliver a robust performance.


Higher earnings period on period were driven by an improved performance in the South


African Retail life insurance business and an improved claims ratio in the South African


short-term insurance business. The former was driven by improved persistency and risk


experience. The latter was assisted by the absence of catastrophic weather-related events


year to date.


Outlook


In line with previous guidance for the twelve months to 31 December 2025, the group


remains committed to delivering:


   ?   Banking revenue growth of mid-to-high single digits;


   ?   Banking revenue growth at or above operating expenses growth, resulting in a flat to


       lower cost-to-income ratio year on year; and


   ?   Group ROE well anchored in the group's target range of 17% to 20%.


The group will provide guidance for 2026 when it reports its financial results for FY25 on 12


March 2026.


Capital Markets Day 2026


Standard Bank Group will host a Capital Markets Day on 26 March 2026. The event will


unpack the strategic and financial drivers that underpin the group's 2028 targets, more

   - Headline earnings per share growth of 8% to 12%; and


   - Return on equity of 18% to 22%.


Further details will be provided closer to the time.
