Results overview


"In 1H25, Standard Bank Group headline earnings per share grew by 10% and return on equity improved to 19.1%. This strong performance was driven


by continued robust franchise momentum and active capital management." - Sim Tshabalala, Group Chief Executive Officer


Group results


In the six months to 30 June 2025 (1H25), Standard Bank Group (the group or Standard Bank) recorded headline earnings of R24 billion and delivered


a return on equity (ROE) of 19.1%. This strong performance was underpinned by continued balance sheet growth, robust fee and trading revenue


growth, and diligently controlled costs. Growth in credit charges was muted as expected. Insurance and Asset Management recorded a continued


upward trajectory in earnings and returns.


The group ended the current period with a strong common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.2%. The group's board approved an interim dividend of 817 cents


per share, up 10% period on period, which equates to an interim dividend payout ratio of 56%.


In 1H25, active clients grew by 2%, driven by growth in both South Africa and Africa Regions. The deployment of personalised, data-driven offers to


clients drove client retention and entrenchment and increased revenue. In South Africa, digital retail clients increased by 7%, successful digital


transactions increased by 12% and digital sales volumes increased by 33%. Together this drove a 21% increase in digital revenue period on period. In


addition, growth in active business clients was underpinned by growth in the transactional and merchant account base in South Africa and targeted


client acquisition strategies in Africa Regions. Investment banking origination reached a new record, driven in particular by opportunities in the Energy


and Infrastructure sector.


Our South African franchises delivered earnings of R11.6 billion, our Africa Regions' franchise R9.7 billion, our Offshore businesses R1.6 billion and the


contribution from our 40% stake in ICBC Standard Bank PLC (ICBCS) was R0.8 billion (contributing 49% ,41%, 6% and 4% respectively to group


headline earnings). The key contributors to Africa Regions' headline earnings remained Angola, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria,


Uganda and Zambia.


We maintained our focus on contributing to positive change in the countries in which we operate. Earlier in the year, we updated our sustainable


finance mobilisation target, increasing it from R250 billion by 2026 to R450 billion by 2028. Since 2022, the group has cumulatively mobilised over


R230 billion in sustainable finance for our clients, of which R53 billion was mobilised in the first half of 2025.


Operating environment


In the first six months of the year, while US tariff announcements initially drove volatility and market fears, this abated somewhat towards the end of


the period and markets recovered. Global inflation and interest rates trended lower, albeit more slowly than initially expected and real gross domestic


product (GDP) growth expectations slowed. On average, inflation eased across the group's portfolio of countries in sub-Saharan Africa (outside of


South Africa). This allowed for central banks in most markets to hold or decrease interest rates. In contrast, interest rates increased in Ghana,


Mauritius and Zambia during this period.


In South Africa, global uncertainty combined with local political developments dented confidence and negatively impacted the growth outlook.


Inflation trended down and was below the bottom of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) target range of 3% to 6% for three consecutive months


before ticking up to 3.0% in June 2025. In response, the SARB cut interest rates by 50 basis points to 7.25% in the six months to June 2025 and a


further 25 basis point cut in July.


Prospects


Trade disputes and high levels of policy uncertainty are expected to have a negative impact on global economic activity but are not expected to disrupt


the significant medium-and long-term opportunities we see across Africa. As at July 2025, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expected global real


GDP growth of 3.0% and 3.1% for 2025 and 2026 respectively. This is down from its March expectation of 3.3% for both years. Global inflation is


expected to continue to decline but at a slower pace than was expected in March 2025. In sub-Saharan Africa, the IMF expects inflation to decline


and growth to be stable in 2025 and pick up in 2026 (IMF July 2025: sub-Saharan Africa real GDP growth of 4.0% and 4.3% in 2025 and 2026).


In South Africa, inflation is expected to remain in the bottom half of the current target range of 3% to 6% for the rest of the year and into 2026.


Interest rates are expected to remain flat for the rest of the year. The SARB's comments that it prefers inflation to be closer to 3%, clouds the outlook


beyond 2025. The South African repo rate is expected to remain flat for the rest of the year followed by one further 25 basis point cut in early 2026.


South African real GDP growth is expected to be 0.9% in 2025 and improve to 1.3% in 2026. This is lower than the 1.7% and 2.0% for 2025 and 2026


respectively, which we expected in March 2025. (Macro expectations as per Standard Bank Research). However, this outlook remains sensitive to


developments on tariffs, including both the rate thereof and the exemptions applied.


We reaffirm the group's three core metrics for the twelve months to 31 December 2025 (FY25). These are summarised as follows:


- Banking revenue growth of mid-to-high single digits in ZAR;


- Banking cost-to-income ratio to be flat to marginally down year on year; and


- Group ROE will remain well anchored in the group's 2025 target range of 17% to 20%.


We remain confident and are firmly on track to deliver on the 2025 targets as outlined to the market in August 2021.


Furthermore, we are committed to delivering the group's 2026 ? 2028 targets as outlined in March 2025:


- Headline earnings per share growth of 8% ? 12%


- ROE within the target range of 18% ? 22%.

Non-resident shareholders may be subject to a reduced rate depending on their country of residence and the application of any Double Tax
