('Truworths International' or the 'Group')


BUSINESS UPDATE


The Group continued to trade well in the first 18 weeks (from 30 June 2025 to 2 November


2025) of the 2026 financial period (the 'current period') in the United Kingdom ('UK') through


its Office stores and advanced online capabilities, outperforming in the UK despite prevailing


macroeconomic headwinds. With the dedicated support of the Group's strong management


team, systems and processes, Office UK has become a highly sought after retail partner for


leading fashion footwear and top sneaker brands worldwide due to its unique positioning and


the brand's strong appeal to both female and male customers.


During the current period Truworths Africa's retail sales growth was constrained compared to


the first 18 weeks (from 1 July 2024 to 3 November 2024) of the 2025 financial period (the


'prior period') when sales were boosted by high levels of promotional activity to ensure that


terminal stock levels were achieved. Notwithstanding the decline in retail sales, the Truworths


Africa gross profit margin has improved since the prior period. Several strategic initiatives


have been initiated to reposition Truworths Africa for the future.


The Group's balance sheet and cash generation remain strong. Based on the Group's positive


net cash position, the board reinitiated the share buyback programme in September 2025.


Group retail sales for the current period were unchanged at R7.2 billion at an improved gross


profit margin, compared to the prior period.


Retail sales performance by business segment was as follows:


                                                           Retail sales           Change on


                                                         current period    prior period (%)


  Group                                                          R7.2bn                   -


  Truworths Africa                                               R4.5bn                -4.0


  Office UK                                                     £113.3m                 6.0


Account sales comprised 45% (prior period: 46%) of Group retail sales, with account sales


decreasing by 3.0% and cash sales increasing by 2.6%, relative to the prior period.


Truworths Africa


Retail sales for the current period decreased by 4.0%. Account sales decreased by 3.0% and


comprised 71% (prior period: 70%) of the segment's retail sales for the current period. Cash


sales decreased by 6.3%.


Truworths Africa's online sales continued to show good growth in the current period,


increasing by 23.3% and contributing 8.3% (prior period: 6.4%) to the segment's retail sales.


As reported in the 2025 financial year-end results, the segment adopted a cautious approach


to credit extension over the last 12 to 18 months, particularly to higher-risk credit customers,


due to the challenging macroeconomic conditions in South Africa. At the end of the first


quarter ended 28 September 2025 ('FY26-Q1'), Truworths Africa's gross active trade


receivables were 3.5% lower at R6.1 billion relative to R6.3 billion at the prior quarter ended


29 September 2024 ('FY25-Q1'). The number of active accounts decreased by 2.8%.


Although this credit strategy constrained credit sales performance, it improved the quality of


the segment's active trade receivables portfolio, with active account holders able to purchase


and overdue balances to gross trade receivables improving to 80% and 16%, respectively, in


FY26-Q1 (FY25-Q1: 79% and 18%). The improvement in these metrics bodes well for credit


extension over the next 12 to 24 months, subject to the continuing application of strict credit-


granting criteria, in what is anticipated to be an improving macroeconomic period.


The number of new accounts opened in the current period exceeded those opened in the prior


period showing strong demand for Truworths Africa's brands and aspirational product.


The consolidation of existing distribution centres and the transition to our new distribution


facility has been completed with part allocation of merchandise to stores now fully


implemented.


Trading space in the Truworths Africa segment is expected to increase by approximately 1%


for the 2026 financial period (measured year-on-year at June 2026).


Office UK


Office UK recorded retail sales growth of 6.0% (in Sterling) relative to the prior period. In


Rand terms, retail sales increased by 7.7% to R2.7 billion (prior period: R2.5 billion). Online


sales for the current period increased by 5.2% and comprised 42.6% of the segment's retail


sales (prior period: 42.9%).


Trading space in the Office UK segment is expected to increase by between 10% to 12% on


a weighted average basis for the 2026 financial period.
