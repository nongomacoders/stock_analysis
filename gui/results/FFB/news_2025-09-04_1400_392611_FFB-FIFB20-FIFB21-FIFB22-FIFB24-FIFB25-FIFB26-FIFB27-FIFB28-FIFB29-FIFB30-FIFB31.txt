Audited financial results for the year ended 30 June 2025 and prospects


"Fortress is a real estate investment company with a portfolio of high-quality


logistics and retail assets. We own a portfolio of logistics properties in South


Africa and Central and Eastern Europe valued at R22,7 billion and a portfolio of


retail properties of R11,8 billion, all located in South Africa. In addition, we


currently hold approximately R15,8 billion in NEPI Rockcastle shares, which


provides exposure to an outstanding retail portfolio in Central and Eastern


Europe. Combined, these holdings provide shareholders, through a listed and


liquid share, with exposure to a portfolio of real estate assets in excess of


R50 billion with a significant development pipeline, paying regular after-tax


dividends.


The real estate market, both in South Africa and globally, has retained the


momentum gained from the reduction in interest rates and better market


fundamentals becoming evident in the latter part of 2024. Investors have


returned to the direct real estate market, and this has provided an underpin


to our direct valuations, which have increased by 6,5% from FY2024 on a


like-for-like basis. The return of investors has also been seen in the listed


real estate market, with our shares currently trading at a 10% discount to


NAV, from over 20% at the start of the financial year.


We continued our focus on a higher-quality portfolio, with the benefits


thereof being evident in our performance for FY2025 and an improved outlook


for FY2026, for which we forecast growth of between 6,0% and 7,5% in


distributable earnings per share.


Our development team again contributed meaningfully to our performance and


reached a milestone with 70% of our current logistics properties having been


developed by our own teams in South Africa and Poland. Our reputation for


delivering high-quality, prime logistics space for tenants continues to grow


and add value to our business.


The retail portfolio delivered strong like-for-like NOI growth of 9,4%,


which is materially above the inflation rate for the year of 3,0%. This


portfolio contributed 35% to our total NOI, and remains a significant driver


of our growth. Our focus on enhancing our retail centres, which are trading


well and have growth potential into the future, combined with disposing of


underperforming centres, has contributed to the outperformance.


Our total distribution for FY2025 of R1,956 billion is an increase of 9,4%


on the prior year. This resulted in a final dividend of 86,29 cents per


share for 2H2025 in addition to the 1H2025 interim after-tax cash dividend


of 76,15 cents per share paid in April 2025. The total distribution for


FY2025 amounted to 162,44 cents per share, with a total shareholder return


in excess of 30% for the financial year. In order to facilitate more


optionality for our diverse shareholder base, an option will be available


to shareholders to receive the final dividend of 86,29 cents per share in


cash or, alternatively, at the shareholders' election, to receive the


dividend as a scrip dividend in the form of NEPI Rockcastle shares at a


ratio of 0,678 for every 100 Fortress B shares held."


Steven Brown, CEO


Nature of the business


Fortress is a real estate investment company with a focus on developing


and letting premium-grade logistics real estate in South Africa and


Central and Eastern Europe ("CEE"), as well as growing our convenience


and commuter-oriented retail portfolio. Fortress owns a direct property

logistics real estate and R11,8 billion of retail real estate. Fortress


holds, at the date of this report, a 15,2% interest in NEPI Rockcastle


N.V. ("NEPI Rockcastle"), the largest listed property company on the


JSE Limited ("JSE"), currently valued at R15,8 billion.


Distributable earnings


Distributable earnings amounted to R1 039,1 million for 2H2025,


compared to R835,6 million for 2H2024. Full-year earnings for FY2025


amounted to R1 956,2 million, compared to R1 788,5 million for FY2024.

every FFB share. Full details of the alternative will be communicated

Fortress-specific assumptions

- NEPI Rockcastle maintains a 90% payout ratio and meets its


published distributable earnings per share guidance for its


financial year ending 31 December 2025;


- No material sales, or acquisitions, outside of our planned pipeline


occur which necessitate a revision to this forecast;


- There is no unforeseen failure of material tenants in our portfolio;


- Contractual escalations and market-related renewals will be


achieved with no major change in vacancy rates;


- Tenants will be able to absorb the recovery of rising utility


costs and municipal rates; and


- The current funding structure provided by the collar over


18,75 million NEPI Rockcastle shares remains intact for the full


period.


Macroeconomic and regulatory assumptions


- There is no unforeseen material macroeconomic deterioration in the


markets in which Fortress has exposure;


- There are no unforeseen adverse socio-political events in the


jurisdictions in which Fortress has exposure;


- There are no changes to current tax legislation in the jurisdictions
