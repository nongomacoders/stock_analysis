REVIEWED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX


MONTHS ENDED 31 AUGUST 2025


1. SALIENT FEATURES


Revenue from ordinary activities increased by R3.5 million from R25.6 million for the six


month period ended 31 August 2024 ('Prior Reporting Period') to R29.1 million in the six


month period ended 31 August 2025 ('Current Reporting Period').


The total comprehensive loss for the period increased by 99.4% from a loss of R67.6 million


in the Prior Reporting Period to a loss R134.8 million in the Current Reporting Period.


The increase in the loss and headline loss per share is primarily attributable to several factors,


including:


    - Once-off transaction costs as a result of the ASP Isotopes combination were incurred;


    - The plant was fully commissioned which has resulted in an increase in the depreciation


      expense for the full Phase 1 plant, which was not the case in the Previous Period;


    - Costs that were capitalised in the Previous Period have been expensed in the Current


      Period; and


    - Increased interest expense leading up to transaction with ASP Isotopes.


Headline loss per share increased by 99.3% from a headline loss of ZAR 0.4573 per share in


the Prior Reporting Period, to a headline loss of ZAR 0.9114 per share in the Current Reporting


Period.


Loss per share increased by 99.3% from a loss of ZAR 0.4573 per share in the Prior Reporting


Period, to a loss of ZAR 0.9114 per share in the Current Reporting Period.


The board of directors has not declared a dividend. (August 2024: nil).


2. SHORT-FORM ANNOUNCEMENT


This short-form announcement is the responsibility of the directors of the Company. It


contains only a summary of the information in the full announcement ('Full Announcement')


and does not contain full or complete details. The Full Announcement can be found at:


https://senspdf.jse.co.za/documents/2025/JSE/ISSE/REN/RENHY26.pdf


A copy of the Full Announcement is also available for viewing on the Company's website


at https://www.renergen.co.za/announcements/.


Any investment decisions by investors and/or shareholders should be based on


consideration of the Full Announcement, as a whole. These interim results have been


reviewed by the Company's auditors, BDO South Africa Incorporated. who expressed an


unmodified review opinion thereon.


The auditors have however drawn the readers' attention to the fact that that while the Group


is finalising its funding initiatives as highlighted during the period, material uncertainty relating


to going concern remains as a result of the required regulatory and lender approvals and the


timely completion of the ASP Isotopes Inc. offer during the assessment period. These


represent material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to


continue as a going concern and therefore, that it may be unable to realise its assets and


discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. Their review conclusion is not


modified in respect of this matter.
