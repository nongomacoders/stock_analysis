Forward-looking statements


This announcement includes forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this


announcement, including, without limitation, those regarding Kumba's financial position, business, acquisition and divestment strategy,


dividend policy, plans and objectives of management for future operations (including development plans and objectives relating to


Kumba's products, production forecasts and Ore Reserves and Mineral Resource estimates), are forward-looking statements. By their


nature, such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual


results, performance, or achievements of Kumba, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or


achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.




Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Kumba's present and future business strategies and the


environment in which Kumba will operate in the future. Important factors that could cause Kumba's actual results, performance or


achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, among others, levels of actual production during


any period, levels of global demand and commodity market prices, mineral resource exploration and development capabilities, recovery


rates and other operational capabilities, the effects of global pandemics and outbreaks of infectious diseases, the availability of mining


and processing equipment, the ability to produce and transport products profitably, the availability of transport infrastructure, the impact


of foreign currency exchange rates on market prices and operating costs, the availability of sufficient credit, the effects of inflation, political


uncertainty and economic conditions, the actions of competitors, activities by governmental authorities such as permitting and changes


in taxation or safety, health, environmental or other types of regulation, conflicts over land and resource ownership rights and such other


risk factors identified in Kumba's most recent Integrated Report. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of


such risk factors and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements.




These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this announcement. Kumba expressly disclaims any obligation or


undertaking (except as required by applicable law, the Takeover Regulation Panel, the Listings Requirements of the securities exchange


of the JSE Limited in South Africa, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority and any other applicable regulations) to release publicly any


updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Kumba's expectations with regard thereto


or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Nothing in this announcement should be


interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of Kumba will necessarily match or exceed its historical published earnings per share.
