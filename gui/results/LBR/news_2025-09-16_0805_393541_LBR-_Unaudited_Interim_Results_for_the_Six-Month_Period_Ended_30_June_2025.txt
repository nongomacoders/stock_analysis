UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2025


Introduction


The Group's performance for the six-month period under review (H1 2025) reflects improved operational


and financial momentum, driven by customer and channel growth, ongoing portfolio and operating model


simplification, and embedding sustainability as a core business practice.


Market Context and Response


The Total Defined Market for Libstar's product basket showed a weakening value trend over the reporting


period. This reflects the relentless pressure on consumers, driven by ongoing food inflationary headwinds


and constrained disposable income.


Libstar responded by:


    ?      Safeguarding and growing market share, especially in Dairy, Wet condiments, and Dry


           condiments;


    ?      Enhancing gross profit margins through effective raw material procurement, better capacity


           utilisation, strategic pricing, and rigorous cost management;


    ?      Sustaining innovation, with new ambient Food Service channel products and extended own-brand


           and private label Retail and Wholesale channel ranges in condiments and baking aids; and


    ?      Driving strong cash generation by normalising dairy inventories and applying disciplined capital


           allocation.


RESULTS SUMMARY


The Group uses Normalised EBITDA, Normalised Earnings per Share (EPS) and Normalised Headline


Earnings per Share (HEPS) from continuing operations, which exclude non-recurring, non-trading, and non-


cash items, as the key measures to reflect its underlying operating performance.

OUTLOOK


In a global environment shaped by ongoing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty, alongside a


persistently constrained local consumer market, Libstar remains steadfast in its focus on resilience,


operational simplification, and long-term, sustainable growth.


Notably, the downward value growth trend in the Group's defined retail product basket has persisted beyond


the reporting period. Given this continued consumer pressure, the Group will focus on:


     -    Driving operational efficiencies across its manufacturing footprint to counter rising input and


          logistics costs


     -    Accelerating innovation and developing value-added products that meet evolving consumer needs


          while reinforcing price-value relevance


     -    Expanding export market presence, adapting to regulatory shifts, trade barriers, and currency


          fluctuations


     -    Building supply chain agility and resilience through enhanced sourcing strategies and deeper


          supplier collaboration


     -    Investing in our people, sustainability, and digital capabilities to strengthen long-term


          competitiveness and deliver responsible growth


Notwithstanding prevailing macroeconomic headwinds, Libstar remains confident in the strength of its


brands, customer partnerships, and operational fundamentals. The Group is well-positioned to manage


short-term volatility while continuing to build for sustainable, long-term value creation.


UPDATE ON STRATEGIC VALUE-UNLOCK PROCESS

there can be no certainty that these engagements will ultimately result in a binding offer to shareholders.
