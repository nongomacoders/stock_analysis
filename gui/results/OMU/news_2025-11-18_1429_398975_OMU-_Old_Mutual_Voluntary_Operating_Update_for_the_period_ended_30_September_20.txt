OLD MUTUAL VOLUNTARY OPERATING UPDATE FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025


Investors are reminded that, as presented during our Capital Markets Day in October, we have refined


our strategic priorities to focus on disciplined execution, operational efficiency, and capital allocation,


all aimed at improving competitive positioning and driving growth. There is a strong commitment to cost


efficiencies over the medium term. With strengthened strategic clarity and a robust balance sheet, the


Group is well positioned to deliver long-term value for shareholders. Progress against the targets set on


our revised value creation metrics, as introduced at our capital markets day, will be reported on from


the 2026 reporting period.


The table below sets out certain key performance indicators for the nine months ended 30 September


2025 compared to the nine month period ended 30 September 2024 ("prior period").


 Key Performance Indicators                             30 September      30 September              change


 (R million unless otherwise stated)                            2025              2024


 Life APE sales (1)                                           10 156             10 052                   1%


 Gross flows   (1)                                           168 995            168 171                   0%


 Net client cash flow   (1)                                   (6 676)           (2 001)             (>100%)


 Loans and advances (2)                                       18 509             18 761                 (1%)


 Gross written premiums                                       21 822             20 735                   5%


(1) The comparatives have been re-presented to exclude China


(2) Comparative amounts represent 31 December 2024 ("FY2024") balance sheet amounts


Life APE sales was marginally higher than the prior period supported by strong risk sales across all


distribution channels in the Mass and Foundation business unit, partially offset by lower guaranteed


annuity sales in the Personal Finance business unit of Old Mutual Life and Savings.


Gross flows were in line with the prior period, supported by strong flows in Old Mutual Africa Regions,


offset by decreased inflows in Old Mutual Investments. The increase in Old Mutual Africa Regions was


driven by higher international fund inflows into money market products in Namibia, strong unit trust


inflows in Uganda and Kenya and increased inflows in Malawi due to new business. Malawi further


benefitted from the impact of inflationary increases on guaranteed fund and group life premiums. Flows


in Old Mutual Investments were down on the prior period due to 2024 having benefitted from significant


inflows in the Equity and Multi Asset and Alternatives capabilities.


Net client cash flow was adversely impacted by significant outflows in Old Mutual Investments, partly


offset by improved inflows in Old Mutual Africa Regions. Old Mutual Investments was impacted by lower


inflows and expected low-margin indexation outflows of R7.8 billion from a significant offshore investor.


Old Mutual Africa Regions' net client cash flow benefitted from lower outflows in East Africa following


the non-recurrence of the prior period loss of high value mandates in Kenya, partially offset by higher


outflows in Namibia and Malawi.


Loans and advances were 1% down from the prior period. The Old Mutual Finance loan book decreased


marginally due to the sale of underperforming loan book and relatively stricter credit criteria, as part of


ongoing actions to improve the quality of the book. Loans and advances in Old Mutual Africa Regions


declined by 3%, driven by lower disbursements and competitive buyoffs in East Africa. This was partly


offset by stronger loan sales in Namibia, supported by targeted debit order campaigns, increased retail


activations, and more competitive pricing.


Gross written premiums increased by 5% compared to the prior period. Old Mutual Insure grew by 7%,


mainly driven by strong growth in ONE Financial Services Holdings, Genric Insurance and the Retail


segment. In Old Mutual Africa Regions, gross written premiums were negatively impacted by lower


renewals in East Africa and the impact of discontinued operations from the Nigeria business, which was


disposed of in June 2024.


We will report progress against the targets set under our revised value creation metrics from Q1 2026.
