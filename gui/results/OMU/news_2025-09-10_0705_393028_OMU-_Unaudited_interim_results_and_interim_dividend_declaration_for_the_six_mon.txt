Unaudited interim results and interim dividend declaration for the six months ended 30 June 2025


Overview of results


The Group delivered adjusted headline earnings of R4.2 billion, uplifting return on net asset value to 15.5% amid


sales and persistency pressures.


Our adjusted headline earnings growth of 29% was driven by strong underwriting performance in Old Mutual Insure and


strong equity market performance, particularly in South Africa and Malawi.


The Board declared an interim dividend of 37 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 9%. Strong cash generation


enabling a R3 billion share buyback reinforces our commitment to unlocking shareholder value.


Our Group equity value decreased to R18.40 per share due to a combination of business impacts and methodology changes.


The Group's value of new business margin reduced to 1.3%, largely due to these changes.


Establishing strategic clarity


Strategic priorities have been sharpened with an emphasis on focused execution, optimising operational efficiencies


and disciplined capital allocation to drive the achievement of a value accretive return on group equity value in the


medium term. As part of our focus on shareholder value creation, we are pivoting to return on group equity value and cash


generation as our value creation metrics. This shift enhances clarity and establishes a demonstrable link between strategic


intent, execution and value creation.


We have set the following four Group strategic priorities, structured to unlock value in the short to medium term,


while positioning the Group to generate growth over the medium to long term:


- Drive the competitiveness of the South African business


- Deepen market leadership in Southern Africa


- Establish the right to win for OM Bank


- Evaluate and pivot on growth markets


Performance overview


Results from operations increased by 16% primarily driven by exceptional growth in Old Mutual Insure and favourable


market conditions. This growth was partially offset by the negative impact of a persistency basis change in Mass and


Foundation Cluster and higher central costs, which includes a once-off restructuring provision incurred to reduce future


expenditure.


Adjusted headline earnings grew by 29%, supported by an 88% increase in shareholder investment returns. The JSE All-Share


Index returned 16.7% in the first half of 2025. Malawi faced elevated equity markets and heightened currency risk as a


result of sustained inflationary pressures.


Return on net asset value was 15.5%, within the target range, supported by earnings and ongoing balance sheet optimisation.


However, excluding higher than expected market returns, return on net asset value would have been below the target range.


IFRS profit and headline earnings declined, mainly reflecting reduced profits from the Zimbabwean business after the


transition of its functional currency from Zimbabwe Gold to the United States dollar. The impact on net asset value


was limited owing to lower currency translation losses reported in equity.


We saw muted sales growth with present value of new business premiums decreasing by 7%. Life APE sales increased by


1%, with higher retail risk volumes in Mass and Foundation Cluster and good sales in Old Mutual Africa Regions largely


offset by lower guaranteed annuity sales in Personal Finance.


Gross flows grew by 7%, driven by good contributions from Wealth Management and Old Mutual Africa Regions, partially


offset by lower inflows in Personal Finance.


Gross written premiums increased by 5% driven by good growth in Old Mutual Insure.


Our discretionary capital balance was R5.9 billion, supported by continued strong cash generation in our South African


Life and Savings businesses and a solid contribution from Old Mutual Insure.


The Board has approved a share buyback of up to R3 billion subject to prevailing market conditions. The buyback will


proceed while the share price reflects a level that is considered accretive to shareholder value.


Our balance sheet remained strong with a Group shareholder solvency ratio of 172%, within our target range of 155% to


185%. Old Mutual Life Assurance Company (South Africa) Limited's (OMLACSA) regulatory solvency ratio was robust at 187%,


well within our target range of 165% to 200%.


The reduction in group equity value to R18.40 per share was driven by business impacts and methodology changes.


Business impacts included an increase in Property and Casualty valuations following continued strong performance


in Old Mutual Insure and a decrease in embedded value.


Total embedded value declined following high capital and dividend outflows of R7.7 billion and model and assumption


changes of R3.7 billion. Assumption and model changes include adjustments for the non-hedgeable risk capital charge from


2% to 3.5% and the strengthening of persistency assumptions in Mass and Foundation Cluster. This was partially offset by


positive economic variances due to good market returns, profitable new business written, repricing some of the


investment business in Old Mutual Africa Regions as well as positive risk experience variances.


The Group's value of new business reduced by 50%, largely due to the assumption and model changes referenced above.


This led to a reduction in the Group value of new business margin to 1.3%.


Group net underwriting margin increased by 270 bps to 7.1% primarily driven by the exceptional performance in Old Mutual Insure.


Group strategic priorities:


Unlocking value


Drive the competitiveness of the South African business


Our South African operations are integral to the Group, with strong market positions, extensive distribution reach and


robust cash generation. To unlock further value, we are driving customer retention and growth in Retail Mass as well as


market share and margin recovery in Personal Finance.


Recent operating model changes have simplified the organisation and created greater clarity and accountability through


the value chain, with streamlined Group functions now supporting targeted and agile execution. This operating approach


enables us to achieve cost leadership, optimise operational efficiencies and strengthen our position within a mature and


highly competitive market.


Deepen market leadership in Southern Africa


We have long-standing presence in markets bordering South Africa, with strong brand equity and deep local insights. To


deepen our market leadership in the region, we are focusing on scaling select markets, expanding our product offerings


and capturing cross-border synergies. This approach builds on Southern Africa's significant contribution to the results


from operations and the return on net asset value generated by Old Mutual Africa Regions.


Generating growth


Establish the right to win for OM Bank


OM Bank is leveraging our existing banking capabilities, which includes R1.5 billion in deposits and R15.5 billion in


lending operations as well as our 346 branch network and FAIS-accredited in-branch advisor force. This allows us to


expand current relationships with our mass-market customers while attracting new customers through a compelling banking


proposition.


Evaluate and pivot on growth markets


As previously communicated, we have completed our exit from life and general insurance operations in Nigeria and


Tanzania and have transitioned South Sudan into run-off. These actions underscore our commitment to concentrating


resources on markets with the greatest potential for sustained long-term value creation. Future capital allocations


will be targeted toward opportunities that align with our strategic priorities, taking cognisance of our goal of


enhancing return on group equity value and return on net asset value to competitive levels in the medium term.


Outlook


Looking ahead, the combination of geopolitical headwinds and resilient market sentiment underpins a cautious but


constructive outlook for the remainder of 2025.


Strategic priorities have been sharpened with an emphasis on focused execution, optimising operational efficiencies


and disciplined capital allocation. Through improved competitive positioning, the Group will be well positioned to lift


growth and market share going forward.


In order to restore our value of new business margin to an acceptable level, we have a strong resolve to drive expense


efficiencies, supported by the operating model redesign and leaner corporate centre.


With strengthened strategic clarity, disciplined execution and a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to


create long-term value for shareholders.

withholding tax of 20%. The net dividend payable to shareholders subject to withholding tax of 20% amounts to


29.60000 cents per ordinary share. Distributions made through the dividend access trust or similar arrangements

tax in the relevant country. We recommend that shareholders consult with their tax adviser regarding the in-country


withholding tax consequences.


Shareholders that are tax residents in jurisdictions other than South Africa may qualify for a reduced rate under


a double taxation agreement with South Africa. To apply for this reduced rate, non-South African taxpayers should


complete and submit a declaration form to the respective registrars. The declaration form can be found at:
