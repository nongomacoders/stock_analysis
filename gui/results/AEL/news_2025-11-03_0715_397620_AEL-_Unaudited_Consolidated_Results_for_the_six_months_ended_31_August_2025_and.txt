KEY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS


-   Netstar continued its growth trajectory with subscribers growing by 11% to 2.1 million. The South Africa


    business delivered strong results, with the turnaround in Australia expected to return that business to


    profitability and make a positive contribution in the second half and for the full year of FY26. EBITDA


    increased by 10% and operating profit by 54%, positively impacted by the change in depreciation policy to


    more closely align with the new proven useful lives of capital rental assets and industry standards.


-   Altron FinTech continued its strong performance, growing revenue 24%, EBITDA by 18% and operating


    profit by 20%. This was mainly driven by ongoing success in attracting new small and medium-sized


    enterprises ("SME") customers to its collections and payment platform, supported by strong growth in sales


    and rentals of point-of-sale ("POS") devices, and the related transaction throughput.


-   Altron Digital Business has had a challenging half-year in a muted IT investment environment. It has


    implemented a profit improvement strategy and remains focused on executing current mandates and


    growing market share.


-   Altron continues to invest in growth with R342 million growth capital expenditure in the period, focused


    primarily on Netstar, Altron FinTech, and systems and platforms.


-   Altron recently launched its AI Factory, providing South African companies with enterprise-level AI


    infrastructure and services, enabling them to build cutting-edge AI solutions and innovate at a competitive


    price on an as-a-service basis.


Commenting on the results CEO Werner Kapp said, "I am pleased with this period's strong financial


performance in the challenging economic environment. I am particularly encouraged by the growth and returns


in our Platforms segment, which we continue to invest behind to support Altron's strategy. Our strong financial


position and cash flow generation have allowed us to increase the interim dividend by 20%."


DETAILED FINANCIAL OVERVIEW


The positive momentum from the 2025 financial year carried into H1 FY26, with Altron delivering another strong


set of results. Revenue from continuing operations declined by 1% to R4.8 billion, reflecting the challenging


environment in the IT Services and Distribution businesses; however, this was offset by robust growth in the


Platforms segment. Group revenue, including discontinued operations, fell by 4% due to a lower contribution


from Altron Nexus in these results.


EBITDA from continuing operations increased by 4% to R938 million, while Group EBITDA rose by 2% to R905


million. At the operating profit level, continuing operations saw a 15% growth to R549 million, with Netstar, Altron


FinTech, Altron HealthTech, and Altron Document Solutions all contributing significant double-digit growth.


Operating profit was positively impacted by the change in Netstar's depreciation policy. The Group achieved a


11% rise in operating profit to R516 million.


The Group remains highly cash-generative and well-capitalised, providing a robust foundation and flexibility for


executing its immediate strategic initiatives. Cash dividend for the period was increased by 20% to 48 cents per


share, reflecting the strong growth in headline earnings.

Platforms


The Platforms segment grew revenue by 12% to R2.2 billion, with EBITDA growing 14% to R881 million and


operating profit up 32% to R547 million.


-   Netstar revenue rose 8% to R1.2 billion, EBITDA grew 10% to R540 million, and operating profit increased


    54% to R225 million.


    -  Netstar continued to grow its market share with the subscriber base growing 11% to 2.1 million.


       248 000 gross subscribers were added during the period, with 81 000 net subscriber additions. Consumer


       subscribers increased by 8%, while higher-margin enterprise customers grew by 16%. Churn, excluding


       original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") partnerships, increased marginally from 17% to 18%.


    -  Key operational metrics were maintained above target levels, with contract fulfilment rate and pre-


       fitment conversion rate above 90% and 60% respectively.


    -  Netstar revised its depreciation policy at the start of the financial year, increasing the depreciation period


       for eligible capital rental devices from three to an average of five years, based on an independently


       calculated useful life assessment. This adjustment better aligns the depreciation pattern of these assets


       with their economic lifespan and industry norms. As a result, the depreciation expense was


       approximately R65 million lower for the period than it would have been under the previous policy.


       Excluding the change in depreciation policy, Netstar's operating profit increased by 10%.


-   Altron FinTech increased its revenue by 24% to R750 million, driven by ongoing success in attracting new


    SME customers to its collections and payment platform and expanding its customer base by over 40%, with


    the number of debit orders reaching 20 million, and value thereof reaching R 24 billion, both increasing by


    more than 30%. In the Integrated Transaction Solutions business, sales and rentals of POS devices saw


    strong growth, with the related transaction throughput growing over 30%. EBITDA rose by 18% to R274 million,


    while operating profit grew by 20% to R257 million.


-   Altron HealthTech revenue remained flat at R201 million, while EBITDA increased by 21% to R67 million,


    and operating profit grew by 20% to R65 million. Annuity revenue rose by 12%, supported by double-digit


    growth in both corporate and private practice network licence revenues and stable switching volumes. This


    was offset by a decline in project revenues. The adoption of data-driven services continues, particularly with


    the oncology solution, as well as an encouraging pipeline in the financial services market.


IT Services


The IT Services segment revenue decreased 7% to R2.4 billion. EBITDA decreased by 41% to R92 million, with


operating profit down 49% to R61 million.


-   Altron Digital Business revenue decreased by 10% to R1.5 billion. The IT Services industry remains muted,


    with the major corporate and public sector IT spenders delaying IT investments in this economic


    environment. Pressure was also felt from changes to OEM partner rebate structures implemented in


    January 2025. EBITDA decreased to a loss of R32 million from a profit of R47 million, and operating profit


    dropped from R34 million to an operating loss of R42 million. Altron Digital Business has implemented a


    profit improvement strategy aimed at removing R150 million from its cost base, the full impact of which will


    be felt in FY27. Altron Digital Business remains focused on executing its current mandates and growing


    market share. Altron Digital Business remains well-positioned for any upturn in the IT services industry.


-   Altron Security revenue increased 2% to R252 million, with growth in software and managed services


    revenue offset by a pullback in integration and professional services. A change in agency versus principal


    mix reduced margins slightly, leading to EBITDA dropping 2% to R78 million. Operating profit increased 6%


    to R70 million, benefiting from a lower depreciation charge this period.


-   Altron Document Solutions revenue decreased 5% to R697 million, EBITDA increased 53% to R46 million,


    and operating profit increased 65% to R33 million. The Africa business experienced top-line pressure, and


    changes in buying patterns were observed, with customers seeking more cost-effective and digitally


    enabled solutions. The A4 and eco-range of refurbished printers performed well, and software and digital


    solution sales more than doubled. EBITDA margins expanded by 2%, driven by the shift in sales mix and


    the profit improvement strategy implemented in FY2024 and FY2025.


Distribution


Altron Arrow reported revenue of R288 million, down 23%. As previously guided, the electronic component


distribution industry has entered a global cyclical downturn, impacting the top line. EBITDA decreased 46% to


R19 million, with operating profit down 49% to R18 million.


Discontinued operations


Altron Nexus was sold during the period, effective 1 August 2025. Altron Nexus contributed revenue of R89


million, and an EBITDA and operating loss of R32 million for the period.


Capital structure and working capital


The Group continued to generate strong operating cash flows of R762 million from Continuing operations(1),


with net cash of R324 million (excluding merchant cash R187 million) on hand at 31 August 2025, after loan


repayments of R425 million and dividend payments of R201 million.


The Group invested R370 million in capital expenditures, of which R342 million supported growth initiatives.


This includes R216 million investment in Netstar's capital rental devices, R32 million in Altron FinTech capital


rental devices, and new initiatives including the AI Factory and HealthTech Oncology solutions of R28.7 million.


Working capital increased by R109 million to R1.5 billion, reflecting the growth in the Platforms segment and


timing differences in IT Services.
