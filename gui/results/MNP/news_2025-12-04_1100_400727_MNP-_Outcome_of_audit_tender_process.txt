Outcome of audit tender process


Mondi plc ("Mondi") announces that, following the conclusion of a formal tender process


for the role of statutory auditor, the Board has approved the reappointment of


PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as Mondi's statutory auditor with effect from the


2027 financial year.


In line with applicable UK regulation, Mondi is required to tender the statutory audit every


10 years and rotate every 20 years. Mondi advised in its Integrated report and financial


statements for the year ended 31 December 2024 that it would conduct a tender process


given Mondi initially appointed PwC with effect from the 2017 financial year.


A resolution to re-appoint PwC with effect from the 2027 financial year will be put to


Mondi's shareholders for approval at Mondi's 2027 Annual General Meeting.
