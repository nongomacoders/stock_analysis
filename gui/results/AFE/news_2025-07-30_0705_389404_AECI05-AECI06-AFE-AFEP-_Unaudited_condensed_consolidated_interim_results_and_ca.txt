FOCUSED EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGY


AECI continues to execute its strategic plan, with a clear focus on building a high-performance culture with


engaged employees, optimising its business portfolio, achieving operational, functional and commercial


excellence and expanding its international presence. During the period, the Group continued to achieve


further key milestones in line with its four strategic pillars:


-   People and culture


      - Continued building a high-performance culture that supports its strategic ambitions


-   Portfolio optimisation


      - Achieved expected disposal proceeds of R2,4 billion to date, R1,1 billion transferred to Group


      - Completed disposals of Much Asphalt and Baar-Ebenhausen


      - Signed agreements for the disposal of Schirm USA and the Food & Beverage businesses


-   Internal value unlock


      - Increased the cumulative EBITDA run rate in terms of the Transformation Management Office (TMO)


        initiative to R1,2 billion (2025 target: R1,6 billion)


-   Internationalisation


      - Improved EBITDA margin in the international business


      - Awarded four new contract wins within Asia-Pacific and Africa


Statement from the Group CEO:


"I am encouraged by the growth of our international operations and the continued resilience of our core


business, particularly in the face of South Africa's challenging operating environment which had an adverse


effect on our reported results.


Despite some setbacks in our strategy execution, particularly under the value unlock pillar, our strategy


remains intact, with clear progress made against key milestones in the period. I continue to be inspired by


the motivation and commitment of our people, who remain central to delivering on our long-term ambitions.


Going into the second half of the year, I look forward to continuing our international growth agenda while


navigating the structural and supplier challenges impacting our business in South Africa, as well as


addressing the delays in our strategy execution programme."


OPERATIONAL REVIEW


The Group's results for the half-year period were mixed. Overall, AECI Mining's international operations


delivered improved performance compared to the period ended 30 June 2024 (the prior period), despite the


South African-based operations being affected by challenging operating conditions and supplier headwinds.


Safety


The Group continued to strengthen its safety culture. The 12-month rolling Total Recordable Injury Rate


(TRIR) improved to 0.20, compared to 0.28 as at 30 June 2024. The Group had no fatalities during the


period.


AECI Mining


The segment recorded a 14% improvement in EBITDA of R1,334 million (H1 2024: R1,172 million) and


EBITDA margin of 15% (H1 2024: 13%) on the back of growth in the international business, coupled with


stringent cost management, partly offset by the South African business being impacted by operational


challenges at the Modderfontein facility and the Lead Azide supply. The prior period was impacted by


R204 million non-recurring statutory shutdown costs.


AECI Chemicals


AECI Chemicals delivered EBITDA of R319 million, down from R467 million in H1 2024, with the EBITDA


margin declining to 7% (H1 2024: 11%). The division continued to face demand and pricing pressures,


which were further exacerbated by the recognition of expected credit losses and foreign exchange losses.


AECI Managed Businesses


In line with our strategy, the business segments within this division have been identified for divestment.


EBITDA for the division increased to R139 million (H1 2024: R101 million, restated).


The restructuring process at AECI Schirm Germany is progressing well, yielding positive results.


In line with the requirements of IFRS 5, since the disposal of Much Asphalt was recognised as a


discontinued operation at 31 December 2024, it required the restatement of financial results for the half year


ended 30 June 2024.


AECI Property Services and Corporate


The segment reported a loss of R189 million, compared to a loss of R458 million in H1 2024. The prior


period's result was impacted by once-off expenditure related to strategy execution.


FINANCIAL REVIEW


The Group delivered solid results, with earnings per share from continuing operations increasing by 70%


compared to H1 2024. This growth was primarily driven by an improved EBITDA, lower net finance costs,


and a reduced effective tax rate, partially offset by costs associated with the Group divestment strategy.


Group headline earnings per share increased by 132% compared to H1 2024.


Driven by the Group's disciplined capital allocation policy and balance sheet optimisation programme, cash


and cash equivalents grew by 6% from the prior period and external debt, including IFRS 16, decreased by


28%.


Net debt decreased to R2,923 million (30 June 2024: R5,096 million), translating to a gearing of 25%


(30 June 2024: 41%) which was within the guided range of 20% - 40%. The Group's net debt to EBITDA, as


defined in covenant agreements, improved to 0.9 times (30 June 2024: 1.6 times), remaining well below the


covenant maximum threshold of 2.5 times.


OUTLOOK


The Group expects full-year EBITDA to be supported by a recovery of volumes in the Asia-Pacific region,


the further realisation of value unlock initiatives, and ongoing internal efficiency programmes. Although the


Group continues to progress towards its targeted EBITDA run rate in line with its strategic ambition, some


delays are anticipated in achieving the run rate due to unrecoverable lost production volumes at the


Modderfontein facility during H1 2025. This resulted in more than usual management focus and effort, which


in turn affected efforts relating to head count efficiency initiatives and delivery on growth capital projects.


Looking ahead to the second half of 2025 and beyond, strategy execution remains a central focus as the


Group prepares for growth, drives hard cost savings, and focuses on free cash flow generation. The


Company expects to continue in a positive performance trajectory in H2 2025, supported by the resilience


and solid underlying performance of its core businesses. However, the Group expects the results to be


behind aspirations as a result of delays in the EBITDA run rate.
