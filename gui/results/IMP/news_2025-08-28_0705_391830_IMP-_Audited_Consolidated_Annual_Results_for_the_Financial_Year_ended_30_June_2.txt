Commentary


Implats delivered a commendable performance across its mining and processing assets in FY2025. Unit costs benefited


from easing input inflation and rand appreciation but faced headwinds from lower production volumes. Following a robust


first half, the Group experienced unplanned furnace maintenance and utility supply and weather-related disruptions at its


base and precious metals refineries. This materially impacted its ability to meet planned refined and sales volumes and


resulted in an increase of excess in-process inventory to approximately 420 000 6E ounces.


Capital expenditure in FY2025 was carefully planned in response to a weak rand PGM price environment and constrained


profitability. Investments were directed toward initiatives that enhance safety, improve operational efficiency and


preserve the integrity of Group infrastructure. Several notable milestones were achieved during the year, including the


commissioning of a 38MW smelter and a 35MW solar power plant at Zimplats.


The Group delivered another strong environmental and sustainability performance. Implats remains firmly committed to


achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and is actively progressing toward its interim target of a 30% reduction in carbon


emissions by FY2030, using FY2019 as the baseline. Renewable energy agreements were concluded to supply power to our


refineries, and the 45MW Phase 2A solar project at Zimplats received approval. Our focus on high-impact, strategic social


performance initiatives continued through programmes supporting community wellbeing, education, skills development and


infrastructure enhancement.


Group profitability was affected by lower sales volumes and muted rand PGM prices, as gains from higher dollar PGM


prices were offset by the strengthening rand. Despite effective cost containment, operational challenges and restructuring


costs at our South African and Canadian assets further impacted earnings. Free cash flow generation improved, despite


lower earnings, and the Group maintained a strong and flexible balance sheet.


Implats generated EBITDA of R9.9 billion, headline earnings of R732 million or 82 cents per share and recorded a free


cash flow of R2.4 billion. The Group closed the period with an adjusted net cash balance (excluding limited recourse


funding) of R8.1 billion and R19.7 billion in liquidity headroom.


FY2026 started with an improved performance at our mining operations and greater stability across the processing assets.


Group production is expected to be supported by sustained momentum at Impala Rustenburg, Mimosa and Two Rivers, while


restored performance at Zimplats and improved stability at Marula bode well for the production outlook. Volumes at


Impala Canada will decline in line with the planned cessation of commercial operations during the year.


Implats has introduced an optimised operating strategy and enhanced maintenance protocols across Group furnaces, with


plans to begin the phased introduction of select design enhancements in FY2026. Further upgrades aimed at ensuring


long-term furnace integrity and performance, while addressing changes in furnace feed mineralogy, will be implemented


in scheduled rebuilds from FY2027.


Our broader strategic agenda is focused on optimal capital allocation and unlocking value across our portfolio.


Supported by a strong and flexible balance sheet, we aim to deliver a resilient and higher-value Implats.


Safety


Implats continues to reinforce its commitment to a safety-first culture across all operations. This is driven by


initiatives that promote personal responsibility, accountability and teamwork. Our approach is anchored in the consistent


implementation of our eight-point safety plan, supported by robust systems and proactive risk management. We place a strong


emphasis on sharing learnings from high-potential incidents and remain deeply committed to the wellbeing of employees


and steadfast in our goal of eliminating fatalities and life-altering injuries, aligned with our vision of achieving zero


harm.


Despite our efforts, it is with deep regret we report eight fatalities in seven incidents at our managed operations


during the period. The Group's fatal-injury frequency rate (FIFR) improved by 55% to 0.057/mmhw (FY2024: 0.127). The


lost-time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) improved 11% to 3.46/mmhw and the total-injury frequency rate (TIFR) showed a


2% improvement to 8.15/mmhw, reflecting an improving trend in our ongoing safety drive.


The formal Department of Minerals and Petroleum Resources (DMPR) inquiry into the 11 Shaft incident began in December 2024


and is expected to continue for 12 to 18 months in total. We remain fully committed to implementing the recommendations


that emerge.


Operational summary


Tonnes milled at Group managed operations decreased by 6% to 26.29 million. Milled throughput at Zimplats was constrained


by lower fleet availability and Impala Canada's volumes declined in line with its revised operating parameters. Production


at Impala Rustenburg and Impala Bafokeng was impacted by safety stoppages, while Marula faced constrained mining flexibility


and navigated extensive labour restructuring. 6E milled grade rose 1% to 3.78 grams per tonne (g/t) as lower development


rates and reduced off-reef mining resulted in improvements at Impala Rustenburg. 6E production at managed operations declined


by 4% to 2.80 million ounces.


6E concentrate production from the Group's joint ventures (JVs) declined by 1% to 542 000 ounces. Mimosa delivered


sustained operating momentum despite intermittent power interruptions and Two Rivers improved its UG2 mining performance,


which was offset by lower milled volumes of low-grade Merensky ore. At Impala Refining Services (IRS), 6E in concentrate


receipts from third-party customers increased by 9% to 209 000 ounces, with better-than-expected deliveries from key


contracts.


In total, Group 6E production decreased by 3% to 3.55 million ounces.


Group processing capacity was limited by unplanned maintenance in South Africa, the commissioning of the expanded


furnace complex at Zimplats, heavy rains and utility supply interruptions at the base and precious metals refineries in


the period. In December 2024, a decision was taken to expedite the full rebuild of Furnace 3 at Impala Rustenburg, while


in early February 2025, unplanned repairs were completed at Furnace 5, resulting in the deferral of 150 000 ounces of


refined 6E production. Interruptions to the water, power and hydrogen supply to Impala Refineries had a further 80 000 6E


ounce impact.


Refined 6E production, which includes saleable ounces from Impala Bafokeng and Impala Canada, was stable at 3.37 million


ounces and Implats ended the period with excess inventory of approximately 420 000 6E ounces.


Implats has introduced an optimised operating strategy and enhanced maintenance protocols across its Group furnaces.


The phased introduction of select design enhancements will commence in FY2026, beginning with the scheduled rebuild of


Furnace 4 in December 2026. Further enhancements include a redesigned furnace configuration aimed at ensuring long-term


integrity and performance, while addressing changes in furnace feed mineralogy. The full rollout of the optimised design


will be incorporated into scheduled rebuilds from FY2027 onward.


In addition, the residual impact of administrative delays affecting the movement of Mimosa concentrate to both IRS and


Zimplats during FY2025, is expected to extend the timeframe for destocking previously accumulated excess inventory.


Completion of this process is now anticipated in FY2029.


Mining inflation across managed operations moderated in the period, while costs also benefitted from a lower labour


complement and the translation of subsidiaries' cash costs at a stronger rand exchange rate. Unit costs were negatively


impacted by ex-gratia payments to employees, the expensing of capital at Impala Canada and lower stock-adjusted equivalent


refined volumes at managed operations. Group stock-adjusted unit costs increased by 7% to R22 491 per 6E ounce and were


5.5% higher at R22 075 per 6E ounce on a like-for-like basis (excluding Impala Canada capex and ex-gratia employee


payments made in the period).


Capital expenditure at managed operations declined 50% to R7.0 billion due to lower growth and replacement capital as


key projects neared completion. Stay-in-business capital retraced as Zimplats completed the first phase of its solar


project and spend at Impala Canada was transferred to working costs, in line with the Groups' accounting policies and the


shortened life-of-mine at the operation. Stay-in-business spend of R5.4 billion, replacement spend of R676 million and


expansion capital of R924 million decreased by 33%, 63% and 77% respectively.


Financial summary


Group profitability was impacted by lacklustre rand PGM pricing, with rand appreciation offsetting the benefit of higher


dollar PGM pricing. Despite good cost containment, this was compounded by operational challenges at the mining and


processing operations and restructuring costs at the South African and Canadian assets.


Revenue of R85.5 billion decreased by 1%, while cost of sales of R83.0 billion increased by 3% and Implats delivered


gross profit of R2.4 billion. Profit for the year ended 30 June 2024 ("prior comparable period") was impacted by several


significant, once-off, non-cash items. There were no impairments in the period under review.


Net foreign exchange losses eased to R294 million, while net finance costs were negligible. Other income comprised the


receipt of insurance proceeds and fair value gains on rehabilitation investments, while other expenses included R635 million


incurred on restructuring costs at managed operations in the period. Included in the restructuring costs is a R440 million


provision for severance in respect of Impala Canada.


The loss from earnings at the JVs - Mimosa and Two Rivers - moderated with earnings in the current period adversely


impacted by the movement of unrealised profit on inventory. Implats achieved EBITDA of R9.9 billion at an EBITDA margin


of 12%.


The R786 million tax charge resulted in an effective tax rate of 53% and was elevated primarily due to not recognising


deferred tax on the losses incurred by Impala Canada during the period, as well as the inclusion of post-tax loss from


associates in profit before tax.


Headline earnings declined by 70% to R732 million and 82 cents per share (FY2024: R2.4 billion and 269 cents per share).


Basic earnings improved to R761 million and 85 cents per share from a loss of R17.3 billion or 1 929 cents per share in


the prior comparable period, when the cumulative impact of impairments resulted in a post-tax charge of R19.8 billion


or 2 204 cents per share.


The weighted average number of shares in issue for the period increased to 897.45 million from 897.36 million in the


prior comparable period, with period-end shares of 904.37 million in issue, unchanged from the prior comparable period.


The Group recorded a free cash inflow of R2.4 billion, after net cash capital outflows of R6.9 billion, and ended the


period with adjusted net cash after debt of R8.1 billion and liquidity headroom of R19.7 billion.


Implats' capital allocation framework aims to sustain and grow meaningful value for all stakeholders and provide


attractive returns to shareholders, while maintaining financial flexibility for the Group.


During the period, Implats invested R6.9 billion in capital expenditure, with a further R0.6 billion allocated to


acquiring shares for the Group's share incentive schemes. After adjusting for foreign exchange translation losses and


R0.9 billion in growth capital, the Group realised an adjusted free cash flow of R2.6 billion.


Implats' dividend policy is premised on returning a minimum of 30% adjusted free cash flow (pre growth capital) to


shareholders. After considering the Group's financial performance, robust balance sheet, future capital requirements and


improving market conditions, the board declared a final cash dividend of 165 cents per share, amounting to R1.5 billion.


Including dividends paid to Impala Chrome minorities in the period, this equates to an approximately 60% allocation of


adjusted free cash flow to shareholder returns in FY2025.


Outlook and guidance


FY2026 began with an improved performance at our mining operations and stability across Group processing assets. Rand


PGM pricing gains were maintained in the early months of FY2026, despite the traditionally quiet Northern Hemisphere


'summer lull' and continued macroeconomic uncertainty, including tariff-related developments. Sales are set to benefit


from the delayed destocking of accumulated in-process inventory.


Our operational focus remains firmly on improving safety outcomes and arresting the unacceptable incidence of fatal


injuries. In FY2026, we will intensify efforts across several key areas: managing the orderly wind-down of commercial


operations at Impala Canada, ensuring continued employee relations stability, realising operational efficiencies at our


newly consolidated Impala operations and securing operational improvements at Marula.


Our broader strategic agenda centres on optimal capital allocation and maximising the optionality and opportunities


within our portfolio, supported by our strong and flexible balance sheet, to deliver a resilient and higher-value


Implats.


Group production in FY2026 will be supported by sustained operating momentum at Impala Rustenburg, Mimosa and Two Rivers,


while restored momentum at Zimplats and improved stability at Marula bode well for the Group's production outlook.


Impala Canada volumes will decline in line with the planned end of commercial operations during the year.


Refined volumes are expected to benefit from improved annual processing availability at both Impala Rustenburg and


Zimplats, driven by an optimised operating strategy and enhanced maintenance protocols, and the destocking of previously


accumulated inventory, a process expected to be completed by FY2029. Group 6E refined and saleable production is expected


to be between 3.4 and 3.6 million ounces. Group unit costs are forecast to rise by between 4% to 9% or R23 500 and


R24 500 per 6E ounce on a stock-adjusted basis. Group capital expenditure is forecast to be between R8 billion and


R9 billion, with negligible growth capital expected. This guidance assumes exchange rates of R18.00/US$ and C$1.39/US$,


respectively.

Dividend declaration


Shareholders are advised that the board has resolved to declare a final gross cash dividend of 165 cents per ordinary


share amounting to R1.5 billion as at the date of declaration, for the financial year ended 30 June 2025. The dividend


will be paid from retained earnings.


In line with Implats' approved dividend policy, which targets a minimum return of 30% of adjusted free cash flow before


growth capital, the board has carefully considered the Groups' financial performance, strong balance sheet, future


capital requirements and improving market conditions. As a result, the final dividend represents an increased payout


of approximately 60% of adjusted free cash flow, reaffirming the Group's commitment to prioritising shareholder returns.


Implats has 904 368 485 ordinary shares in issue and the Company's tax reference number is 9700178719. The cash dividend


will be subject to a 20% dividend withholding for shareholders who are not exempt from, or do not qualify for, a reduced


rate of withholding tax. Therefore, the net dividend amount is 132.00000 cents per ordinary share for shareholders liable


to pay the dividend withholding tax and 165 cents per ordinary share for shareholders exempt from dividend withholding


tax. Shareholders are advised to complete the requisite declaration form available from Computershare to inform the


Company of their tax status.


The salient dates are as follows:


Declaration date:                                                       Thursday, 28 August 2025


Last day for trading to be eligible for cash dividend:                Tuesday, 16 September 2025
