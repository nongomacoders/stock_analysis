**The underlying view of the results excludes material once-offs and accounting


adjustments. Underlying results constitute pro-forma financial information in


terms of the JSE Listings Requirements. Refer to the "Reconciliation between


unadjusted and underlying results" section provided as part of the summary


consolidated financial statements for further details.


RCL FOODS delivered a pleasing performance notwithstanding subdued


market conditions and volume pressure across most categories.


Underlying EBITDA from continuing operations increased by 7.9% to


R2 390,6 million (2024: R2 216,1 million) largely due to a strong


turnaround in Baking and a pleasing Groceries result. Sugar


declined from its high base.


Within Groceries, the Grocery operating unit delivered an improved


result driven by a favourable product mix in pet food with more


focus placed on premium brands, savings resulting from net revenue


management (NRM) and continuous improvement (CI)           initiatives,


production efficiencies and reduced load shedding.


A strong turnaround across all operating units was achieved in the


Baking segment largely driven by a combination of NRM and CI


initiatives, operational efficiencies and innovation. The Bread,


Buns and Rolls operating unit delivered a significant improvement


in EBITDA, despite only modest volume growth of 1.3%. Milling


delivered a strong performance due to a more favourable sales mix


and overall improved margins, despite lower volumes. The Pies


operating unit delivered an improvement in EBITDA through delivery


of its volume recovery plan. Speciality delivered a second year of


good performance, with higher volumes and margins achieved by


maintaining the right mix of products through innovation and


promotional levels.


Albeit down on the prior year, Sugar delivered another strong


absolute result aided by a pleasing agricultural and manufacturing


operational performance. The local industry faced pressure in the


second half of the year largely due to reduced consumer demand and


a substantial increase in imports. The Molatek operating unit


delivered another good result, driven by a favourable sales mix and


improved operational efficiencies.


Sugar's result includes accounting for a R91,0 million partial


recovery of the additional levy raised by the South African Sugar


Association in our 2023 financial year. The recovery is excluded


from the underlying view of results.


Our term-debt package, which expired in December 2024, was


successfully refinanced at R1,5 billion.


Discontinued operations results in the current period relates to


the non-cash gain of R198,5 million realised on accounting for the


unbundling of Rainbow, as well as a R7,3 million downward


adjustment to the Vector Logistics profit on disposal, largely


relating to the final settlement of the RCL FOODS share options


granted to Vector Logistics employees whilst still in employment at


RCL FOODS as per terms of the sale agreement.
