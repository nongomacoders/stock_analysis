highly profitable fintech-driven business, offering financial solutions and homeware products


tailored to 3.7 million connected, mobile-savvy urban South African women.


CEO, Sean Wibberley, commented:


"I am extremely pleased with the strong financial performance delivered in the first half of FY2025,


driven predominantly by our Fintech business, with group profit before tax up 48%.


During this period, the group rebranded from HomeChoice International plc to Weaver Fintech Ltd.


This new name better reflects our strategic evolution, with Fintech now firmly established as


the primary engine of growth and profitability. 98% of the group's profits originate from our


Fintech ecosystem - a fully integrated suite of fintech products offered to 3 100 merchants and


3.3 million customers.


Our results show how deeply our ecosystem resonates with customers and merchants. We are not


just scaling - we're transforming how financial services are accessed and experienced across


South Africa. With a solid technology foundation and a rapidly expanding user base, the group


is well positioned for continued profitability, innovation and lasting impact on digital financial


inclusion," concludes Wibberley.
