TRADING UPDATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 2025




Lewis Group delivered a solid performance for the nine months to December 2025, with


total revenue increasing by 11.1%, driven by strong growth in credit sales and other


revenue, despite constrained discretionary consumer spending.




Group merchandise sales grew by 7.1%. Credit sales increased by 9.1%, accounting for


69.4% (Dec 2024: 68.2%) of total sales. Cash sales increased by 2.8% for the nine months.




Group merchandise sales for the third quarter to December 2025 increased by 7.8%,


supported by strong Black Friday sales across all brands, following growth of 8.9% and


4.6% for the first and second quarters respectively.




Comparable store sales grew by 4.3% for the nine-month period and 4.9% for the third


quarter.




Other revenue, consisting of effective interest income and ancillary services income as well


as insurance revenue, benefited from the strong credit sales in recent years, increasing by


16.2% for the nine months and 15.2% for the third quarter.




The collection rate remained resilient at a satisfactory 78.3% for the nine months (Dec


2024: 79.6%), consistent with the rate reported for the half year to September 2025.




Debtor costs grew by 14.8% for the nine-month period and by 16.9% for the third quarter


primarily driven by the growth in the debtors book and continued macro-economic pressure


on consumers.

not been reviewed or reported on by the group's independent auditor. The group's annual


results for the year to 31 March 2026 are expected to be released on SENS on or about 28
