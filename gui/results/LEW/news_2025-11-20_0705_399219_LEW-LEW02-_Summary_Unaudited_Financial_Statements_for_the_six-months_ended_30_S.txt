carrying value improving to 6.8% from 6.9%. The debtors impairment provision as a

by 250 basis points to 20.7%. Impairments and capital items totalled R20.7 million (H1


2025: R7.9 million) relating to the impairment of right-of-use assets in UFO.




Net finance costs were R26.7 million higher at R114.4 million due to higher levels of


borrowings resulting from the investment in the debtors book and store expansion over


the reporting period.




The Group's net borrowings totalled R1 481 million at 30 September 2025. The gearing


ratio (including lease liabilities) increased to 48.5% (H1 2025: 46.1%) and the borrowings


ratio (gearing ratio, excluding lease liabilities) increased to 29.0% (H1 2025: 26.5%).




Headline earnings increased by 16.0% to R335.1 million. Earnings per share increased


13.8% to 619 cents and headline earnings per share by 16.8% to 648 cents, reflecting


the positive leverage effect of share repurchases undertaken in prior years.




The interim dividend was increased by 12.3% to 337 cents per share, based on an


earnings payout ratio of 55%.




The Group's balance sheet remains strong and the net asset value per share increased


by 6.6% to R98.23.




Outlook


Against the backdrop of continued uncertainty in global markets and local political


instability, discretionary spending is expected to remain constrained in the short-to


medium-term as consumers experience increasing financial pressure.




While lower inflation and reduced borrowing costs are positive for consumers,


persistently high unemployment and limited job creation in the country's low growth


environment continue to weigh on consumer confidence.




Appealing marketing campaigns and promotions are planned across all brands to drive


sales growth during the Black Friday and festive season trading period, supported by


new merchandise ranges and good stock availability.




Management intends to open a further 15 to 20 stores in the second half of the year,


mainly in the specialist bedding brands.
