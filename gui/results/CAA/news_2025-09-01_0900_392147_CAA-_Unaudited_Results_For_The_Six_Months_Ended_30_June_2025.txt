UNAUDITED RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2025


1. NATURE OF BUSINESS


     CA&S is a collective of fully integrated fast-moving consumer goods service providers


     operating in several Southern and East African countries. We offer route-to-market


     solutions across borders to some of the world's most admired consumer brand owners.


     Our route-to-market solutions include selling and distributing fast-moving consumer goods


     as well as services such as retail execution and advisory, retail support, technology and


     data solutions, and training.


     The group collaborates with clients, taking brands beyond borders and navigating the


     supply chain to reach stores, shelves, baskets and trolleys. We ensure availability for and


     visibility to shoppers, including promoting the brands. Working closely with clients, we


     address trade obstacles, enhance shelf presence and safeguard and build market shares.


2.   SALIENT FEATURES


     Revenue growth was mainly driven by organic growth, acquisitions and expansion into


     new regions. Revenue increased by 4.0% to R5.96 billion, from R5.73 billion in the prior


     corresponding period.


     Operating profit for the interim period increased by 9.6% to R334.67 million, from R305.38


     million in the prior corresponding period.


     Earnings per share increased by 15.5% to 50.72 South African cents ("cents") per share,


     from 43.90 cents per share in the prior corresponding period.


     Headline earnings increased by 16.9% to R241.72 million, from R206.83 million in the prior


     corresponding period.


     Headline earnings per share increased by 16.1% to 50.44 cents per share, from 43.45


     cents per share in the prior corresponding period.


     Total assets increased by 16.3% to R5.85 billion due to the expansion of warehouse


     capacity, intangible assets as a result of business combinations, investments in associates


     as well as cash and working capital to support revenue growth.


     No dividend has been declared for the six months ended 30 June 2025 (H1 2024: nil), as


     it is the Company's policy to only declare dividends once a year, after its year-end.


3.   OUTLOOK


     We remain optimistic about the prospects in Southern and East Africa. Our in-depth market


     knowledge enables us to navigate inherent risks effectively. With average economic


     growth of around 3% across most markets, the region continues to show robust growth


     potential. Ongoing investment in infrastructure, efforts towards economic diversification,


     and a favourable business climate further enhance its appeal. Moreover, the combination


     of expanding urban centres and sizeable rural populations underlines a growing demand


     for consumer-packaged brands, signalling strong prospects for sustained growth and


     development.


     We remain conscious of the challenges surrounding cost control and the need for targeted


     strategic investment. Through disciplined financial management, we are well placed to


     capitalise on opportunities that should secure the long-term success of CA&S and our


     clients.
