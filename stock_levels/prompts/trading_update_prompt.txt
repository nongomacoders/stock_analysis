Please provide a strategy to anticipate the price movement for the JSE-listed stock AXX, which is due to release its financial results soon.

Key Context & Assumption:

The company has not released a trading update.

JSE rules state that a company must release a trading update if they anticipate earnings will change by more than 20% compared to the corresponding previous reporting period.

Therefore, we can assume that the upcoming earnings are expected to be within a 20% range (either positive or negative) of the earnings from the last corresponding period.

Required Actions:

Review the financial results of the "corresponding previous period" for AXX.

Based on that review, provide a potential price range for AXX stock.
